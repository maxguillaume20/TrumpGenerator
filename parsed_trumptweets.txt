Melania and I are hosting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Mrs. Abe at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla. They are a wonderful couple!

I am reading that the great border WALL will cost more than the government originally thought, but I have not gotten involved in the design or negotiations yet. When I do, just like with the F-35 FighterJet or the Air Force One Program, price will come WAY DOWN! 

Our legal system is broken! "77% of refugees allowed into U.S. since travel reprieve hail from seven suspect countries." (WT) SO DANGEROUS!

The failing @nytimes does major FAKE NEWS China story saying "Mr.Xi has not spoken to Mr. Trump since Nov.14." We spoke at length yesterday!

LAWFARE: "Remarkably, in the entire opinion, the panel did not bother even to cite this (the) statute." A disgraceful decision!

SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!

Sen. McCain should not be talking about the success or failure of a mission to the media. Only emboldens the enemy! He's been losing so long he doesn't know how to win anymore, just look at the mess our country is in - bogged down in conflict all over the place. Our hero Ryan died on a winning mission ( according to General Mattis), not a "failure." Time for the U.S. to get smart and start winning again! 

Chris Cuomo, in his interview with Sen. Blumenthal, never asked him about his long-term lie about his brave "service" in Vietnam. FAKE NEWS!

Sen.Richard Blumenthal, who never fought in Vietnam when he said for years he had (major lie),now misrepresents what Judge Gorsuch told him?

Big increase in traffic into our country from certain areas, while our people are far more vulnerable, as we wait for what should be EASY D!

My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom . She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!

I will be speaking at 9:00 A.M. today to Police Chiefs and Sheriffs and will be discussing the horrible, dangerous and wrong decision.......

If the U.S. does not win this case as it so obviously should, we can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled. Politics!

It is a disgrace that my full Cabinet is still not in place, the longest such delay in the history of our country. Obstruction by Democrats!

I don't know Putin, have no deals in Russia, and the haters are going crazy - yet Obama can make a deal with Iran, #1 in terror, no problem!

The threat from radical Islamic terrorism is very real, just look at what is happening in Europe and the Middle-East. Courts must act fast!

The failing @nytimes was forced to apologize to its subscribers for the poor reporting it did on my election win. Now they are worse!

The failing @nytimes writes total fiction concerning me. They have gotten it wrong for two years, and now are making up stories & sources!

I call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it. Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies!

Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election. Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting.

What an amazing comeback and win by the Patriots. Tom Brady, Bob Kraft and Coach B are total winners. Wow!

Enjoy the #SuperBowl and then we continue: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I have instructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY. The courts are making the job very difficult!

Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!

The judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. Bad people are very happy!

Interview with @oreillyfactor on Fox Network - 4:00 P.M. (prior to Super Bowl). Enjoy!

Why aren't the lawyers looking at and using the Federal Court decision in Boston, which is at conflict with ridiculous lift ban decision?

Because the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. A terrible decision

What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.?

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

After being forced to apologize for its bad and inaccurate coverage of me after winning the election, the FAKE NEWS @nytimes is still lost!

The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!

Interesting that certain Middle-Eastern countries agree with the ban. They know if certain people are allowed in it's death & destruction!

When a country is no longer able to say who can, and who cannot , come in & out, especially for reasons of safety &.security - big trouble!

Countries charge U.S. companies taxes or tariffs while the U.S. charges them nothing or little.We should charge them SAME as they charge us!

We must keep "evil" out of our country!

A new radical Islamic terrorist has just attacked in Louvre Museum in Paris. Tourists were locked down. France on edge again. GET SMART U.S.

Professional anarchists, thugs and paid protesters are proving the point of the millions of people who voted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Meeting with biggest business leaders this morning. Good jobs are coming back to U.S., health care and tax bills are being crafted NOW!

Thank you to Prime Minister of Australia for telling the truth about our very civil conversation that FAKE NEWS media lied about. Very nice!

Iran is playing with fire - they don't appreciate how "kind" President Obama was to them. Not me!

Yes, Arnold Schwarzenegger did a really bad job as Governor of California and even worse on the Apprentice...but at least he tried hard!

Iran was on its last legs and ready to collapse until the U.S. came along and gave it a life-line in the form of the Iran Deal: $150 billion

Iran has been formally PUT ON NOTICE for firing a ballistic missile.Should have been thankful for the terrible deal the U.S. made with them!

Attending Chief Ryan Owens' Dignified Transfer yesterday with my daughter Ivanka was my great honor. To a great and brave man - thank you!

Congratulations to Rex Tillerson on being sworn in as our new Secretary of State. He will be a star!

If U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view - NO FEDERAL FUNDS?

Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!

Iran is rapidly taking over more and more of Iraq even after the U.S. has squandered three trillion dollars there. Obvious long ago!

Everybody is arguing whether or not it is a BAN. Call it what you want, it is about keeping bad people (with bad intentions) out of country!

Hope you like my nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for the United States Supreme Court. He is a good and brilliant man, respected by all.

Getting ready to deliver a VERY IMPORTANT DECISION! 8:00 P.M.

When will the Democrats give us our Attorney General and rest of Cabinet! They should be ashamed of themselves! No wonder D.C. doesn't work!

Nancy Pelosi and Fake Tears Chuck Schumer held a rally at the steps of The Supreme Court and mic did not work (a mess)-just like Dem party!

The Democrats are delaying my cabinet picks for purely political reasons. They have nothing going but to obstruct. Now have an Obama A.G.

Where was all the outrage from Democrats and the opposition party (the media) when our jobs were fleeing our country?

I have made my decision on who I will nominate for The United States Supreme Court. It will be announced live on Tuesday at 8:00 P.M. (W.H.)

If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the "bad" would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad "dudes" out there!

There is nothing nice about searching for terrorists before they can enter our country. This was a big part of my campaign. Study the world!

Only 109 people out of 325,000 were detained and held for questioning. Big problems at airports were caused by Delta computer outage, protesters and the tears of Senator Schumer. Secretary Kelly said that all is going well with very few problems. MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN! 

I will be interviewed by @TheBrodyFile on @CBNNews tonight at 11pm. Enjoy!

The joint statement of former presidential candidates John McCain & Lindsey Graham is wrong - they are sadly weak on immigration. The two Senators should focus their energies on ISIS, illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III. 

Christians in the Middle-East have been executed in large numbers. We cannot allow this horror to continue!

Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW. Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world - a horrible mess!

Somebody with aptitude and conviction should buy the FAKE NEWS and failing @nytimes and either run it correctly or let it fold with dignity!

The coverage about me in the @nytimes and the @washingtonpost gas been so false and angry that the times actually apologized to its dwindling subscribers and readers.They got me wrong right from the beginning and still have not changed course, and never will. DISHONEST 

The failing @nytimes has been wrong about me from the very beginning. Said I would lose the primaries, then the general election. FAKE NEWS!

The #MarchForLife is so important. To all of you marching --- you have my full support!

Mexico has taken advantage of the U.S. for long enough. Massive trade deficits & little help on the very weak border must change, NOW!

Look forward to seeing final results of VoteStand. Gregg Phillips and crew say at least 3,000,000 votes were illegal. We must do better!

Will be interviewed by @SeanHannity on @FoxNews at 10:00pm tonight. Enjoy!

of jobs and companies lost. If Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting.

The U.S. has a 60 billion dollar trade deficit with Mexico. It has been a one-sided deal from the beginning of NAFTA with massive numbers...

Ungrateful TRAITOR Chelsea Manning, who should never have been released from prison, is now calling President Obama a weak leader. Terrible!

Interview with David Muir of @ABC News in 10 minutes. Enjoy!

I will be making my Supreme Court pick on Thursday of next week.Thank you!

even, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures!

I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and....

Big day planned on NATIONAL SECURITY tomorrow. Among many other things, we will build the wall!

If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible "carnage" going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds!

Congratulations to @FoxNews for being number one in inauguration ratings. They were many times higher than FAKE NEWS @CNN - public is smart!

Will be meeting at 9:00 with top automobile executives concerning jobs in America. I want new plants to be built here for cars sold here!

Busy week planned with a heavy focus on jobs and national security. Top executives coming in at 9:00 A.M. to talk manufacturing in America.

Peaceful protests are a hallmark of our democracy. Even if I don't always agree, I recognize the rights of people to express their views.

Wow, television ratings just out: 31 million people watched the Inauguration, 11 million more than the very good ratings from 4 years ago!

Watched protests yesterday but was under the impression that we just had an election! Why didn't these people vote? Celebs hurt cause badly.

Had a great meeting at CIA Headquarters yesterday, packed house, paid great respect to Wall, long standing ovations, amazing people. WIN!

A fantastic day and evening in Washington D.C.Thank you to @FoxNews and so many other news outlets for the GREAT reviews of the speech!

We will follow two simple rules: BUY AMERICAN & HIRE AMERICAN! #InaugurationDay #MAGA

We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth - and we will bring back our dreams!

The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. From this moment on, it’s going to be #AmericaFirst

January 20th 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.

What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people.

power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the American People. #InaugurationDay

Today we are not merely transferring power from one Administration to another, or from one party to another – but we are transferring...

It all begins today! I will see you at 11:00 A.M. for the swearing-in. THE MOVEMENT CONTINUES - THE WORK BEGINS!

"It wasn't Donald Trump that divided this country, this country has been divided for a long time!" Stated today by Reverend Franklin Graham.

Looking forward to a speedy recovery for George and Barbara Bush, both hospitalized. Thank you for your wonderful letter!

. @TheAlabamaBand was great last night in D.C. playing for 147 Diplomats and Ambassadors from countries around the world. Thanks Alabama!

No wonder the Today Show on biased @NBC is doing so badly compared to its glorious past. Little credibility!

"Bayer AG has pledged to add U.S. jobs and investments after meeting with President-elect Donald Trump, the latest in a string..." @WSJ

to the U.S., but had nothing to do with TRUMP, is more FAKE NEWS. Ask top CEO's of those companies for real facts. Came back because of me!

Totally biased @NBCNews went out of its way to say that the big announcement from Ford, G.M., Lockheed & others that jobs are coming back...

Will be interviewed by @ainsleyearhardt on @foxandfriends - Enjoy!

Thank you to General Motors and Walmart for starting the big jobs push back into the U.S.!

"thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush's swearing-in....he doesn't believe Bush is the true elected president." Sound familiar! WP

John Lewis said about my inauguration, "It will be the first one that I've missed." WRONG (or lie)! He boycotted Bush 43 also because he...

country and with the massive cost reductions I have negotiated on military purchases and more, I believe the people are seeing "big stuff."

With all of the jobs I am bringing back into the U.S. (even before taking office), with all of the new auto plants coming back into our.....

The same people who did the phony election polls, and were so wrong, are now doing approval rating polls. They are rigged just like before.

People are pouring into Washington in record numbers. Bikers for Trump are on their way. It will be a great Thursday, Friday and Saturday!

At 9:00 P.M. @CNN , of all places, is doing a Special Report on my daughter, Ivanka. Considering it is CNN, can't imagine it will be great!

Celebrate Martin Luther King Day and all of the many wonderful things that he stood for. Honor him for being the great man that he was!

much worse - just look at Syria (red line), Crimea, Ukraine and the build-up of Russian nukes. Not good! Was this the leaker of Fake News?

. @FoxNews "Outgoing CIA Chief, John Brennan, blasts Pres-Elect Trump on Russia threat. Does not fully understand." Oh really, couldn't do...

. @NBCNews is bad but Saturday Night Live is the worst of NBC. Not funny, cast is terrible, always a complete hit job. Really bad television!

about that...Those Intelligence chiefs made a mistake here, & when people make mistakes, they should APOLOGIZE." Media should also apologize

Thank you to Bob Woodward who said, "That is a garbage document...it never should have been presented...Trump's right to be upset (angry)...

For many years our country has been divided, angry and untrusting. Many say it will never change, the hatred is too deep. IT WILL CHANGE!!!!

will only get higher. Car companies and others, if they want to do business in our country, have to start making things here again. WIN!

The Democrats are most angry that so many Obama Democrats voted for me. With all of the jobs I am bringing back to our Nation, that number..

Inauguration Day is turning out to be even bigger than expected. January 20th, Washington D.C. Have fun!

Congressman John Lewis should finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities of the U.S. I can use all the help I can get!

INTELLIGENCE INSIDERS NOW CLAIM THE TRUMP DOSSIER IS "A COMPLETE FRAUD!" @OANN

mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk - no action or results. Sad!

Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to......

All of my Cabinet nominee are looking good and doing a great job. I want them to be themselves and express their own thoughts, not mine!

Congrats to the Senate for taking the first step to #RepealObamacare - now it's onto the House! – bei Trump Tower

. @CNN is in a total meltdown with their FAKE NEWS because their ratings are tanking since election and their credibility will soon be gone!

Thank you to Linda Bean of L.L.Bean for your great support and courage. People will support you even more now. Buy L.L.Bean. @LBPerfectMaine

James Clapper called me yesterday to denounce the false and fictitious report that was illegally circulated. Made up, phony facts.Too bad!

We had a great News Conference at Trump Tower today. A couple of FAKE NEWS organizations were there but the people truly get what's going on

Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to "leak" into the public. One last shot at me.Are we living in Nazi Germany?

I win an election easily, a great "movement" is verified, and crooked opponents try to belittle our victory with FAKE NEWS. A sorry state!

Russia has never tried to use leverage over me. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA - NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!

Russia just said the unverified report paid for by political opponents is "A COMPLETE AND TOTAL FABRICATION, UTTER NONSENSE." Very unfair!

FAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!

Ford said last week that it will expand in Michigan and U.S. instead of building a BILLION dollar plant in Mexico. Thank you Ford & Fiat C!

It's finally happening - Fiat Chrysler just announced plans to invest $1BILLION in Michigan and Ohio plants, adding 2000 jobs. This after...

"groveling" when he totally changed a 16 year old story that he had written in order to make me look bad. Just more very dishonest media!

Meryl Streep, one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood, doesn't know me but attacked last night at the Golden Globes. She is a.....

Rupert Murdoch is a great guy who likes me much better as a very successful candidate than he ever did as a very successful developer!

Dishonest media says Mexico won't be paying for the wall if they pay a little later so the wall can be built more quickly. Media is fake!

Before I, or anyone, saw the classified and/or highly confidential hacking intelligence report, it was leaked out to @NBCNews . So serious!

Kellyanne Conway went to @MeetThePress this morning for an interview with @chucktodd . Dishonest media cut out 9 of her 10 minutes. Terrible!

I look very much forward to meeting Prime Minister Theresa May in Washington in the Spring. Britain, a longtime U.S. ally, is very special!

Congratulation to Jane Timken on her major upset victory in becoming the Ohio Republican Party Chair. Jane is a loyal Trump supporter & star

both countries will, perhaps, work together to solve some of the many great and pressing problems and issues of the WORLD!

Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. Only "stupid" people, or fools, would think that it is bad! We.....

Only reason the hacking of the poorly defended DNC is discussed is that the loss by the Dems was so big that they are totally embarrassed!

Intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results. Voting machines not touched!

Gross negligence by the Democratic National Committee allowed hacking to take place.The Republican National Committee had strong defense!

Monitoring the terrible situation in Florida. Just spoke to Governor Scott. Thoughts and prayers for all. Stay safe!

I am asking the chairs of the House and Senate committees to investigate top secret intelligence shared with NBC prior to me seeing it.

Anna Wintour came to my office at Trump Tower to ask me to meet with the editors of Conde Nast & Steven Newhouse, a friend. Will go this AM.

Hopefully, all supporters, and those who want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will go to D.C. on January 20th. It will be a GREAT SHOW!

and knew they were in big trouble - which is why they cancelled their big fireworks at the last minute.THEY SAW A MOVEMENT LIKE NEVER BEFORE

Hillary and the Dems were never going to beat the PASSION of my voters. They saw what was happening in the last two weeks before the......

The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later!

So how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers? What is going on?

The Democratic National Committee would not allow the FBI to study or see its computer info after it was supposedly hacked by Russia......

How did NBC get "an exclusive look into the top secret report he (Obama) was presented?" Who gave them this report and why? Politics!

Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax.

to make up their own minds as to the truth. The media lies to make it look like I am against "Intelligence" when in fact I am a big fan!

The dishonest media likes saying that I am in Agreement with Julian Assange - wrong. I simply state what he states, it is for the people....

The Democrats, lead by head clown Chuck Schumer, know how bad ObamaCare is and what a mess they are in. Instead of working to fix it, they do the typical political thing and BLAME. The fact is ObamaCare was a lie from the beginning."Keep you doctor, keep your plan!" It is time for Republicans & Democrats to get together and come up with a healthcare plan that really works - much less expensive & FAR BETTER! 

Jackie Evancho's album sales have skyrocketed after announcing her Inauguration performance.Some people just don't understand the "Movement"

massive increases of ObamaCare will take place this year and Dems are to blame for the mess. It will fall of its own weight - be careful!

like the 116% hike in Arizona. Also, deductibles are so high that it is practically useless. Don't let the Schumer clowns out of this web...

Republicans must be careful in that the Dems own the failed ObamaCare disaster, with its poor coverage and massive premium increases......

things they did and said (like giving the questions to the debate to H). A total double standard! Media, as usual, gave them a pass.

Somebody hacked the DNC but why did they not have "hacking defense" like the RNC has and why have they not responded to the terrible......

Thank you to Ford for scrapping a new plant in Mexico and creating 700 new jobs in the U.S. This is just the beginning - much more to follow

Julian Assange said "a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta" - why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info!

The "Intelligence" briefing on so-called "Russian hacking" was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange!

I will be having a general news conference on JANUARY ELEVENTH in N.Y.C. Thank you.

There should be no further releases from Gitmo. These are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield.

With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it may be, their number one act and priority. Focus on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance! #DTS 

The Democrat Governor.of Minnesota said "The Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) is no longer affordable!" - And, it is lousy healthcare.

People must remember that ObamaCare just doesn't work, and it is not affordable - 116% increases (Arizona). Bill Clinton called it "CRAZY"

General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!

China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won't help with North Korea. Nice!

North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen!

I thought and felt I would win big, easily over the fabled 270 (306). When they cancelled fireworks, they knew, and so did I.

Various media outlets and pundits say that I thought I was going to lose the election. Wrong, it all came together in the last week and.....

@CNN just released a book called "Unprecedented" which explores the 2016 race & victory. Hope it does well but used worst cover photo of me!

Chicago murder rate is record setting - 4,331 shooting victims with 762 murders in 2016. If Mayor can't do it he must ask for Federal help!

Well, the New Year begins. We will, together, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don't know what to do. Love!

Russians are playing @CNN and @NBCNews for such fools - funny to watch, they don't have a clue! @FoxNews totally gets it!

Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!

not anymore. The beginning of the end was the horrible Iran deal, and now this (U.N.)! Stay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching!

We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect. They used to have a great friend in the U.S., but.......

Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks.Thought it was going to be a smooth transition - NOT!

The U.S. Consumer Confidence Index for December surged nearly four points to 113.7, THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN MORE THAN 15 YEARS! Thanks Donald!

President Obama campaigned hard (and personally) in the very important swing states, and lost.The voters wanted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

The DJT Foundation, unlike most foundations, never paid fees, rent, salaries or any expenses. 100% of money goes to wonderful charities!

I gave millions of dollars to DJT Foundation, raised or recieved millions more, ALL of which is given to charity, and media won't report!

The world was gloomy before I won - there was no hope. Now the market is up nearly 10% and Christmas spending is over a trillion dollars!

The United Nations has such great potential but right now it is just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time. So sad!

President Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me. He should say that but I say NO WAY! - jobs leaving, ISIS, OCare, etc.

Merry Christmas and a very, very, very , very Happy New Year to everyone!

The big loss yesterday for Israel in the United Nations will make it much harder to negotiate peace.Too bad, but we will get it done anyway!

. @NBCNews purposely left out this part of my nuclear qoute: "until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes." Dishonest!

Vladimir Putin said today about Hillary and Dems: "In my opinion, it is humiliating. One must be able to lose with dignity." So true!

slaughter you. This is a purely religious threat, which turned into reality. Such hatred! When will the U.S., and all countries, fight back?

The terrorist who killed so many people in Germany said just before crime, "by God's will we will slaughter you pigs, I swear, we will......

As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th.

my presidency. Isn't this a ridiculous shame? He loves these kids, has raised millions of dollars for them, and now must stop. Wrong answer!

My wonderful son, Eric, will no longer be allowed to raise money for children with cancer because of a possible conflict of interest with...

The so-called "A" list celebrities are all wanting tixs to the inauguration, but look what they did for Hillary, NOTHING. I want the PEOPLE!

Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!

The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes

Someone incorrectly stated that the phrase "DRAIN THE SWAMP" was no longer being used by me. Actually, we will always be trying to DTS.

I met some really great Air Force GENERALS and Navy ADMIRALS today, talking about airplane capability and pricing. Very impressive people!

I have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that I spent FAR LESS MONEY on the win than Hillary on the loss!

I would have done even better in the election, if that is possible, if the winner was based on popular vote - but would campaign differently

Campaigning to win the Electoral College is much more difficult & sophisticated than the popular vote. Hillary focused on the wrong states!

Yes, it is true - Carlos Slim, the great businessman from Mexico, called me about getting together for a meeting. We met, HE IS A GREAT GUY!

especially how to get people, even with an unlimited budget, out to vote in the vital swing states ( and more). They focused on wrong states

Bill Clinton stated that I called him after the election. Wrong, he called me (with a very nice congratulations). He "doesn't know much" ...

We did it! Thank you to all of my great supporters, we just officially won the election (despite all of the distorted and inaccurate media).

Today there were terror attacks in Turkey, Switzerland and Germany - and it is only getting worse. The civilized world must change thinking!

If my many supporters acted and threatened people like those who lost the election are doing, they would be scorned & called terrible names!

We should tell China that we don't want the drone they stole back.- let them keep it!

China steals United States Navy research drone in international waters - rips it out of water and takes it to China in unprecedented act.

Mobile, Alabama today at 3:00 P.M. Last rally of the year - "THANK YOU ALABAMA AND THE SOUTH" Biggest of all crowds expected, see you there!

Last night in Orlando, Florida, was incredible - massive crowd - THANK YOU FLORIDA! Today at 3:00 P.M. I will be in Alabama for last rally!

Well, we all did it, together! I hope the "MOVEMENT" fans will go to D.C. on Jan 20th for the swearing in. Let's set the all time record!

Are we talking about the same cyberattack where it was revealed that head of the DNC illegally gave Hillary the questions to the debate?

If Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?

The media tries so hard to make my move to the White House, as it pertains to my business, so complex - when actually it isn't!

Thank you to Time Magazine and Financial Times for naming me "Person of the Year" - a great honor!

Has anyone looked at the really poor numbers of @VanityFair Magazine. Way down, big trouble, dead! Graydon Carter, no talent, will be out!

The thing I like best about Rex Tillerson is that he has vast experience at dealing successfully with all types of foreign governments.

Wisconsin and Pennsylvania have just certified my wins in those states. I actually picked up additional votes!

I have chosen one of the truly great business leaders of the world, Rex Tillerson, Chairman and CEO of ExxonMobil, to be Secretary of State.

I will hold a press conference in the near future to discuss the business, Cabinet picks and all other topics of interest. Busy times!

Presidency. Two of my children, Don and Eric, plus executives, will manage them. No new deals will be done during my term(s) in office.

Even though I am not mandated by law to do so, I will be leaving my busineses before January 20th so that I can focus full time on the......

I will be making my announcement on the next Secretary of State tomorrow morning.

The final Wisconsin vote is in and guess what - we just picked up an additional 131 votes. The Dems and Green Party can now rest. Scam!

The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.

Unless you catch "hackers" in the act, it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking. Why wasn't this brought up before election?

Can you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the Russia/CIA card. It would be called conspiracy theory!

Just watched @NBCNightlyNews - So biased, inaccurate and bad, point after point. Just can't get much worse, although @CNN is right up there!

Will be interviewed on @FoxNews at 10:00 P.M. Enjoy!

Whether I choose him or not for "State"- Rex Tillerson, the Chairman & CEO of ExxonMobil, is a world class player and dealmaker. Stay tuned!

I spent Friday campaigning with John Kennedy, of the Great State of Louisiana, for the U.S.Senate. The election is over - JOHN WON!

Being at the Army - Navy Game was fantastic. There is nothing like the spirit in that stadium. A wonderful experience, and congrats to Army!

I will be interviewed today on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace at 10:00 (Eastern) Network. ENJOY!

Reports by @CNN that I will be working on The Apprentice during my Presidency, even part time, are ridiculous & untrue - FAKE NEWS!

As a show of support for our Armed Forces, I will be going to The Army-Navy Game today. Looking forward to it, should be fun!

I have NOTHING to do with The Apprentice except for fact that I conceived it with Mark B & have a big stake in it. Will devote ZERO TIME!

. @RudyGiuliani , one of the finest people I know and a former GREAT Mayor of N.Y.C., just took himself out of consideration for "State".

Today we lost a great pioneer of air and space in John Glenn. He was a hero and inspired generations of future explorers. He will be missed.

If United Steelworkers 1999 was any good, they would have kept those jobs in Indiana. Spend more time working-less time talking. Reduce dues

Chuck Jones, who is President of United Steelworkers 1999, has done a terrible job representing workers. No wonder companies flee country!

I will be interviewed on the @TODAYshow at 7:30. Enjoy!

Masa said he would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election!

Masa (SoftBank) of Japan has agreed to invest $50 billion in the U.S. toward businesses and 50,000 new jobs....

Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!

If the press would cover me accurately & honorably, I would have far less reason to "tweet." Sadly, I don't know if that will ever happen!

their country (the U.S. doesn't tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea? I don't think so!

Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into..

. @FoxNews will be re-running "Objectified: Donald Trump," the ratings hit produced by the great Harvey Levin of TMZ, at 8:00 P.M. Enjoy!

The Green Party just dropped its recount suit in Pennsylvania and is losing votes in Wisconsin recount. Just a Stein scam to raise money!

Just tried watching Saturday Night Live - unwatchable! Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse. Sad

Our great VPE, @mike_pence , is in Louisiana campaigning for John Kennedy for US Senate. John will be a tremendous help to us in Washington.

State Treasurer John Kennedy is my choice for US Senator from Louisiana. Early voting today; election next Saturday.

Rexnord of Indiana is moving to Mexico and rather viciously firing all of its 300 workers. This is happening all over our country. No more!

Interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call.

The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you!

Getting ready to leave for the Great State of Indiana and meet the hard working and wonderful people of Carrier A.C.

My thoughts and prayers are with those affected by the tragic storms and tornadoes in the Southeastern United States. Stay safe!

Look forward to going to Indiana tomorrow in order to be with the great workers of Carrier. They will sell many air conditioners!

Hence, legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations. The Presidency is a far more important task!

I will be going to Indiana on Thursday to make a major announcement concerning Carrier A.C. staying in Indianapolis. Great deal for workers!

My thoughts and prayers are with the great people of Tennessee during these terrible wildfires. Stay safe!

Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag - if they do, there must be consequences - perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!

I thought that @CNN would get better after they failed so badly in their support of Hillary Clinton however, since election, they are worse!

The Great State of Michigan was just certified as a Trump WIN giving all of our MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN supporters another victory - 306!

. @CNN is so embarrassed by their total (100%) support of Hillary Clinton, and yet her loss in a landslide, that they don't know what to do.

"@sdcritic: @HighonHillcrest @jeffzeleny @CNN There is NO QUESTION THAT #voterfraud did take place, and in favor of #CorruptHillary !"

Just met with General Petraeus--was very impressed!

If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate deal.

Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California - so why isn't the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem!

states instead of the 15 states that I visited. I would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)!

It would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4--

In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally

Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in. Nothing will change

The Democrats, when they incorrectly thought they were going to win, asked that the election night tabulation be accepted. Not so anymore!

The Green Party scam to fill up their coffers by asking for impossible recounts is now being joined by the badly defeated & demoralized Dems

Fidel Castro is dead!

I am working hard, even on Thanksgiving, trying to get Carrier A.C. Company to stay in the U.S. (Indiana). MAKING PROGRESS - Will know soon!

Happy Thanksgiving to everyone. We will, together, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Bus crash in Tennessee so sad & so terrible. Condolences to all family members and loved ones. These beautiful children will be remembered!

I am seriously considering Dr. Ben Carson as the head of HUD. I've gotten to know him well--he's a greatly talented person who loves people!

The meeting with the @nytimes is back on at 12:30 today. Look forward to it!

Great meetings will take place today at Trump Tower concerning the formation of the people who will run our government for the next 8 years.

The failing @nytimes just announced that complaints about them are at a 15 year high. I can fully understand that - but why announce?

Perhaps a new meeting will be set up with the @nytimes . In the meantime they continue to cover me inaccurately and with a nasty tone!

I cancelled today's meeting with the failing @nytimes when the terms and conditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment. Not nice

Many people would like to see @Nigel_Farage represent Great Britain as their Ambassador to the United States. He would do a great job!

Prior to the election it was well known that I have interests in properties all over the world.Only the crooked media makes this a big deal!

I have always had a good relationship with Chuck Schumer. He is far smarter than Harry R and has the ability to get things done. Good news!

General James "Mad Dog" Mattis, who is being considered for Secretary of Defense, was very impressive yesterday. A true General's General!

I watched parts of @nbcsnl Saturday Night Live last night. It is a totally one-sided, biased show - nothing funny at all. Equal time for us?

Numerous patriots will be coming to Bedminster today as I continue to fill out the various positions necessary to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

The cast and producers of Hamilton, which I hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior

The Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!

Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing.This should not happen!

The ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad!

I settled the Trump University lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as President I have to focus on our country.

Will be working all weekend in choosing the great men and women who will be helping to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!

Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico

My transition team, which is working long hours and doing a fantastic job, will be seeing many great candidates today. #MAGA

Australia, New Zealand, and more. I am always available to them. @nytimes is just upset that they looked like fools in their coverage of me.

I have recieved and taken calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing @nytimes said. Russia, U.K., China, Saudi Arabia, Japan,

The failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition. It is going so smoothly. Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaders.

I am not trying to get "top level security clearance" for my children. This was a typically false news story.

Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!

The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much different!

If the election were based on total popular vote I would have campaigned in N.Y. Florida and California and won even bigger and more easily

The debates, especially the second and third, plus speeches and intensity of the large rallies, plus OUR GREAT SUPPORTERS, gave us the win!

I will be interviewed on @60Minutes tonight after the NFL game - 7:00 P.M. Enjoy!

The @nytimes states today that DJT believes "more countries should acquire nuclear weapons." How dishonest are they. I never said this!

Governor John Kasich of the GREAT, GREAT, GREAT State of Ohio called to congratulate me on the win. The people of Ohio were incredible!

Jeb Bush, George W and George H.W. all called to express their best wishes on the win. Very nice!

Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win. Very nice!

The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change - doubt it?

Wow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the "Trump phenomena"

This will prove to be a great time in the lives of ALL Americans. We will unite and we will win, win, win!

Busy day planned in New York. Will soon be making some very important decisions on the people who will be running our government!

Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud!

Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!

A fantastic day in D.C. Met with President Obama for first time. Really good meeting, great chemistry. Melania liked Mrs. O a lot!

Such a beautiful and important evening! The forgotten man and woman will never be forgotten again. We will all come together as never before

Don't let up, keep getting out to vote - this election is FAR FROM OVER! We are doing well but there is much time left. GO FLORIDA!

Just out according to @CNN : "Utah officials report voting machine problems across entire country"

I will be watching the election results from Trump Tower in Manhattan with my family and friends. Very exciting!

TODAY WE MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Big news to share in New Hampshire tonight! Polls looking great! See you soon. – bei Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport (AVP)

Hey Missouri let's defeat Crooked Hillary & @koster4missouri ! Koster supports Obamacare & amnesty! Vote outsider Navy SEAL @EricGreitens !

Watch Coach Mike Ditka- a great guy and supporter tonight at 8pmE on #WattersWorld with @jessebwatters @FoxNews .

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

If Obama worked as hard on straightening out our country as he has trying to protect and elect Hillary, we would all be much better off!

Looking at Air Force One @MIA. Why is he campaigning instead of creating jobs & fixing Obamacare? Get back to work for the American people!

ObamaCare is a total disaster. Hillary Clinton wants to save it by making it even more expensive. Doesn't work, I will REPEAL AND REPLACE!

My wife, Melania, will be speaking in Pennsylvania this afternoon. So exciting, big crowds! I will be watching from North Carolina.

Praying for the families of the two Iowa police who were ambushed this morning. An attack on those who keep us safe is an attack on us all.

Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 e-mails AFTER they were subpoenaed by the United States Congress. Guilty - cannot run. Rigged system!

I am going to repeal and replace ObamaCare. We will have MUCH less expensive and MUCH better healthcare. With Hillary, costs will triple!

You can change your vote in six states. So, now that you see that Hillary was a big mistake, change your vote to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

. @DarrellIssa is a very good man. Help him win his congressional seat in California.

So terrible that Crooked didn't report she got the debate questions from Donna Brazile, if that were me it would have been front page news!

Crooked Hillary should not be allowed to run for president. She deleted 33,000 e-mails AFTER getting a subpoena from U.S. Congress. RIGGED!

Wow, now leading in @ABC / @washingtonpost Poll 46 to 45. Gone up 12 points in two weeks, mostly before the Crooked Hillary blow-up!

Look at the way Crooked Hillary is handling the e-mail case and the total mess she is in. She is unfit to be president. Bad judgement!

Wow, Twitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton. Very dishonest media!

Hillary and the Dems loved and praised FBI Director Comey just a few days ago. Original evidence was overwhelming, should not have delayed!

We are now leading in many polls, and many of these were taken before the criminal investigation announcement on Friday - great in states!

"@DeplorableCBTP: "In my mind, #DonaldTrump is the only way out of this mess." - #PhilRobertson of TV's #DuckDynasty " Thank you Phil!

I am in Colorado - big day planned - but nothing can be as big as yesterday!

Just landed in Iowa - speaking soon!

Just out: Neera Tanden, Hillary Clinton adviser said, “Israel is depressing.” I think Israel is inspiring!

Heading to New Hampshire. Will be talking about the disaster known as ObamaCare!

If my people said the things about me that Podesta & Hillary's people said about her, I would fire them out of self respect. "Bad instincts"

I will be interviewed on @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:00 P.M. Enjoy!

A lot of call-ins about vote flipping at the voting booths in Texas. People are not happy. BIG lines. What is going on?

REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE!

REPEAL AND REPLACE!!! #ObamaCareInThreeWords

Obamacare is a disaster. Rates going through the sky - ready to explode. I will fix it. Hillary can't! #ObamacareFailed

We are winning and the press is refusing to report it. Don't let them fool you- get out and vote! #DrainTheSwamp on November 8th!

Why has nobody asked Kaine about the horrible views emanated on WikiLeaks about Catholics? Media in the tank for Clinton but Trump will win!

Major story that the Dems are making up phony polls in order to suppress the the Trump . We are going to WIN!

Wow, just came out on secret tape that Crooked Hillary wants to take in as many Syrians as possible. We cannot let this happen - ISIS!

The attack on Mosul is turning out to be a total disaster. We gave them months of notice. U.S. is looking so dumb. VOTE TRUMP and WIN AGAIN!

Well, Iran has done it again. Taken two of our people and asking for a fortune for their release. This doesn't happen if I'm president!

"If you can't run your own house you certainly can't run the White House" A statement made by Mrs. Obama about Crooked Hillary Clinton

The media refuses to talk about the three new national polls that have me in first place. Biggest crowds ever - watch what happens!

Just returned from Pennsylvania where we will be bringing back their jobs. Amazing crowd. Will be going back tomorrow, to Gettysburg!

The results are in on the final debate and it is almost unanimous, I WON! Thank you, these are very exciting times.

Why didn't Hillary Clinton announce that she was inappropriately given the debate questions - she secretly used them! Crooked Hillary.

That was really exciting. Made all of my points. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama and that’s what you’ll get if you vote for Hillary. #BigLeagueTruth

I started this campaign to Make America Great Again. That’s what I’m going to do. #MAGA #debate

USA has the greatest business people in the world but we let political hacks negotiate our deals. We need change! #BigLeagueTruth #Debate

Bernie Sanders on HRC: Bad Judgement. John Podesta on HRC: Bad Instincts. #BigLeagueTruth #Debate

Our country is stagnant. We’ve lost jobs and business. We don’t make things anymore b/c of the bill Hillary’s husband signed and she blessed

I will renegotiate NAFTA. If I can’t make a great deal, we’re going to tear it up. We’re going to get this economy running again. #Debate

Moderator: Hillary plan calls for more regulation and more government spending. #Debate #BigLeagueTruth

Moderator: Hillary paid $225,000 by a Brazilian bank for a speech that called for “open borders.” That’s a quote! #Debate #BigLeagueTruth

Hillary is too weak to lead on border security-no solutions, no ideas, no credibility.She supported NAFTA, worst deal in US history. #Debate

One of my first acts as President will be to deport the drug lords and then secure the border. #Debate #MAGA

Drugs are pouring into this country. If we have no border, we have no country. That’s why ICE endorsed me. #Debate #BigLeagueTruth

. @HillaryClinton lists litany of ways she plans to restrict gun rights. 2A will not survive a Hillary presidency. #Debate #BigLeagueTruth

The 2nd Amendment is under siege. We need SCOTUS judges who will uphold the US Constitution. #Debate #BigLeagueTruth

I will be handing over my Twitter account to my team of deplorables for tonight's #debate #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

My wife, Melania, will be interviewed tonight at 8:00pm by Anderson Cooper on @CNN . I have no doubt she will do very well. Enjoy!

I will sign the first bill to repeal #Obamacare and give Americans many choices and much lower rates!

New polls are good because the media has deceived the public by putting women front and center with made-up stories and lies, and got caught

Wow, new polls just came out from @CNN Great numbers, especially after total media hit job. Leading Ohio 48 - 44.

Voter fraud! Crooked Hillary Clinton even got the questions to a debate, and nobody says a word. Can you imagine if I got the questions?

We have all got to come together and win this election. We can't have four more years of Obama (or worse!).

Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day. Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!

Can't believe these totally phoney stories, 100% made up by women (many already proven false) and pushed big time by press, have impact!

ALL SAFE IN ORANGE COUNTY, NORTH CAROLINA. With you all the way, will never forget. Now we have to win. Proud of you all! @NCGOP

Animals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina just firebombed our office in Orange County because we are winning @NCGOP

Wow, interview released by Wikileakes shows "quid pro quo" in Crooked Hillary e-mail probe.Such a dishonest person - & Paul Ryan does zilch!

Finally, in the new ABC News/Washington Post Poll, Hillary Clinton is down 11 points with WOMEN VOTERS and the election is close at 47-43!

Paul Ryan, a man who doesn't know how to win (including failed run four years ago), must start focusing on the budget, military, vets etc.

The Democrats have a corrupt political machine pushing crooked Hillary Clinton. We have Paul Ryan, always fighting the Republican nominee!

The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary - but also at many polling places - SAD

Election is being rigged by the media, in a coordinated effort with the Clinton campaign, by putting stories that never happened into news!

Polls close, but can you believe I lost large numbers of women voters based on made up events THAT NEVER HAPPENED. Media rigging election!

Watched Saturday Night Live hit job on me.Time to retire the boring and unfunny show. Alec Baldwin portrayal stinks. Media rigging election!

A great day in New Hampshire and Maine. Fantastic crowds and energy! #MAGA

The failing @nytimes reporters don't even call us anymore, they just write whatever they want to write, making up sources along the way!

Nothing ever happened with any of these women. Totally made up nonsense to steal the election. Nobody has more respect for women than me!

Landing in New Hampshire soon to talk about the massive drug problem there, and all over the country.

Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted and should be in jail. Instead she is running for president in what looks like a rigged election

This election is being rigged by the media pushing false and unsubstantiated charges, and outright lies, in order to elect Crooked Hillary!

100% fabricated and made-up charges, pushed strongly by the media and the Clinton Campaign, may poison the minds of the American Voter. FIX!

Dem Gov. of MN. just announced that the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) is no longer affordable. I've been saying this for years- disaster!

Great event in Columbus- taking off for Cincinnati now. Great new Ohio poll out- thank you! OHIO NBC/WSJ/MARIST POLL Trump 42% Clinton 41%

Just left a great rally in Florida - now heading to Ohio for two more. Will be there soon.

I am making a major speech in West Palm Beach, Florida at noon. Tune in!

The phony story in the failing @nytimes is a TOTAL FABRICATION. Written by same people as last discredited story on women. WATCH!

Why didn't the writer of the twelve year old article in People Magazine mention the "incident" in her story. Because it did not happen!

The people of Cuba have struggled too long. Will reverse Obama's Executive Orders and concessions towards Cuba until freedoms are restored.

Very little pick-up by the dishonest media of incredible information provided by WikiLeaks. So dishonest! Rigged system!

Crooked Hillary Clinton likes to talk about the things she will do but she has been there for 30 years - why didn't she do them?

Wow, @CNN Town Hall questions were given to Crooked Hillary Clinton in advance of big debates against Bernie Sanders. Hillary & CNN FRAUD!

I hope people are looking at the disgraceful behavior of Hillary Clinton as exposed by WikiLeaks. She is unfit to run.

In Texas now, leaving soon for BIG rally in Florida!

The very foul mouthed Sen. John McCain begged for my support during his primary (I gave, he won), then dropped me over locker room remarks!

Disloyal R's are far more difficult than Crooked Hillary. They come at you from all sides. They don’t know how to win - I will teach them!

With the exception of cheating Bernie out of the nom the Dems have always proven to be far more loyal to each other than the Republicans!

It is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to.

Our very weak and ineffective leader, Paul Ryan, had a bad conference call where his members went wild at his disloyalty.

Despite winning the second debate in a landslide (every poll), it is hard to do well when Paul Ryan and others give zero support!

Wow, @CNN got caught fixing their "focus group" in order to make Crooked Hillary look better. Really pathetic and totally dishonest!

Paul Ryan should spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting Republican nominee

Thank you for all of the great comments on the debate last night. Very exciting!

Hypocrite! @HillaryClinton claims she needs a “public and a private stance” in discussions with Wall Street banks. #Debate

We must repeal Obamacare and replace it with a much more competitive, comprehensive, affordable system. #debate #MAGA

ATTN: @HillaryClinton - Why did five of your staffers need FBI IMMUNITY?! #BigLeagueTruth #Debates

Hillary’s 33,000 deleted emails about her daughter’s wedding. That’s a lot of wedding emails. #debate

Basically nothing Hillary has said about her secret server has been true. #CrookedHillary

If I win-I am going to instruct my AG to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation bc there's never been anything like your lies.

There’s never been anyone more abusive to women in politics than Bill Clinton.My words were unfortunate-the Clintons’ actions were far worse

I’m not proud of my locker room talk. But this world has serious problems. We need serious leaders. #debate #BigLeagueTruth

It’s this simple. “Make America Great Again.” #debate #BigLeagueTruth

My team of deplorables will be taking over my Twitter account for tonight's #debate #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

So many self-righteous hypocrites. Watch their poll numbers - and elections - go down!

Tremendous support (except for some Republican "leadership"). Thank you.

Thank you to my great supporters in Wisconsin. I heard that the crowd and enthusiasm was unreal!

The media and establishment want me out of the race so badly - I WILL NEVER DROP OUT OF THE RACE, WILL NEVER LET MY SUPPORTERS DOWN! #MAGA

Certainly has been an interesting 24 hours!

Praying for everyone in Florida. Hoping the hurricane dissipates, but in any event, please be careful.

EARLY VOTING: MN & IA already underway, more states coming up in the next week: OH, ME, AZ, IN — check w/local officials for details & VOTE!

Thank you @SenJohnMcCain for your kind remarks on the important issue of PTSD and the dishonest media. Great to be in Arizona yesterday!

Bill Clinton is right: Obamacare is 'crazy', 'doesn't work' and 'doesn't make sense'. Thanks Bill for telling the truth.

The constant interruptions last night by Tim Kaine should not have been allowed. Mike Pence won big!

Mike Pence won big. We should all be proud of Mike!

I agree Mike - thank you to all of our law enforcement officers! #VPDebate "Police officers are the best of us..." @Mike_Pence

. @mike_pence is doing a great job - so far, no contest!

. @megynkelly - I am in Nevada. Sorry to inform you Kellyanne is in the audience. Better luck next time.

Both are looking good! Now we begin!

Here we go - Enjoy!

I will be live-tweeting the V.P. Debate. Very exciting! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Wow, @CNN is so negative. Their panel is a joke, biased and very dumb. I'm turning to @FoxNews where we get a fair shake! Mike will do great

Wow, did you just hear Bill Clinton's statement on how bad ObamaCare is. Hillary not happy. As I have been saying, REPEAL AND REPLACE!

I will be watching the great Governor @Mike_Pence and live tweeting the VP debate tonight starting at 8:30pm est! Enjoy!

Just announced that Iraq (U.S.) is preparing for battle to reclaim Mosul. Why do they have to announce this? Makes mission much harder!

Melania and I extend our warmest greetings to those observing Rosh Hashanah here in the United States, in Israel, and around the world.

Bernie should pull his endorsement of Crooked Hillary after she decieved him and then attacked him and his supporters.

I have created tens of thousands of jobs and will bring back great American prosperity. Hillary has only created jobs at the FBI and DOJ!

I know our complex tax laws better than anyone who has ever run for president and am the only one who can fix them. #failing @nytimes

Heading to Pennsylvania for a big rally tonight. We will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Wow, just saw the really bad @CNN ratings. People don't want to watch bad product that only builds up Crooked Hillary.

The so-called Commission on Presidential Debates admitted to us that the DJT audio & sound level was very bad. So why didn't they fix it?

I won the debate if you decide without watching the totally one-sided "spin" that followed. This despite the really bad microphone.

For those few people knocking me for tweeting at three o'clock in the morning, at least you know I will be there, awake, to answer the call!

The people are really smart in cancelling subscriptions to the Dallas & Arizona papers & now USA Today will lose readers! The people get it!

Remember, don't believe "sources said" by the VERY dishonest media. If they don't name the sources, the sources don't exist.

Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?

Using Alicia M in the debate as a paragon of virtue just shows that Crooked Hillary suffers from BAD JUDGEMENT! Hillary was set up by a con.

Wow, Crooked Hillary was duped and used by my worst Miss U. Hillary floated her as an "angel" without checking her past, which is terrible!

Anytime you see a story about me or my campaign saying "sources said," DO NOT believe it. There are no sources, they are just made up lies!

Wow, did you see how badly @CNN (Clinton News Network) is doing in the ratings. With people like @donlemon , who could expect any more?

My condolences to those involved in today's horrible accident in NJ and my deepest gratitude to all of the amazing first responders.

Joining @oreillyfactor from Waukesha, Wisconsin - now, live! Enjoy!

Every on-line poll, Time Magazine, Drudge etc., has me winning the debate. Thank you to Fox & Friends for so reporting!

In the last 24 hrs. we have raised over $13M from online donations and National Call Day, and we’re still going! Thank you America! #MAGA

Well, now they're saying that I not only won the NBC Presidential Forum, but last night the big debate. Nice!

Hillary's been failing for 30 years in not getting the job done - it will never change.

The #1 trend on Twitter right now is #TrumpWon - thank you!

I won every poll from last nights Presidential Debate - except for the little watched @CNN poll.

I really enjoyed the debate last night.Crooked Hillary says she is going to do so many things.Why hasn't she done them in her last 30 years?

Great debate poll numbers - I will be on @foxandfriends at 7:00 to discuss. Enjoy!

. @newtgingrich just said "a historic victory for Trump." NICE!

Wow, did great in the debate polls (except for @CNN - which I don't watch). Thank you!

Nothing on emails. Nothing on the corrupt Clinton Foundation. And nothing on #Benghazi . #Debates2016 #debatenight

Russia has more warheads than ever, N Korea is testing nukes, and Iran got a sweetheart deal to keep theirs. Thanks, @HillaryClinton .

This is the simple fact about @HillaryClinton : she is a typical politician - all talk, no action. #Debates2016

. @HillaryClinton has been part of the rigged DC system for 30 years? Why would we take policy advice from her? #Debates2016

. @HillaryClinton channels John Kerry on trade: she was for bad trade deals before she was against them. #TPP #Debates2016

. @HillaryClinton and Obama policies increased debt by $9trillion over the last 8 years

My team of deplorables will be managing my Twitter account for this evenings debate. Tune in! #DebateNight #TrumpPence16

Really sad news: The great Arnold Palmer, the "King," has died. There was no-one like him - a true champion! He will be truly missed.

Five people killed in Washington State by a Middle Eastern immigrant. Many people died this weekend in Ohio from drug overdoses. N.C. riots!

Looking forward to my meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu in Trump Tower at 10:00 A.M.

Bernie Sanders gave Hillary the Dem nomination when he gave up on the e-mails. That issue has only gotten bigger!

Many on the team and staff of Bernie Sanders have been treated badly by the Hillary Clinton campaign - and they like Trump on trade, a lot!

If dopey Mark Cuban of failed Benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row, perhaps I will put Gennifer Flowers right alongside of him!

The @SenTedCruz endorsement was a wonderful surprise. I greatly appreciate his support! We will have a tremendous victory on November 8th.

Crooked Hillary's bad judgement forced her to announce that she would go to Charlotte on Saturday to grandstand. Dem pols said no way, dumb!

Hillary Clinton just lost every Republican she ever had, including Never Trump, all farmers & sm. biz, by saying she’ll tax estates at 65%.

Spoke with Governor @PatMcCroryNC of North Carolina today. He is doing a tremendous job under tough circumstances.

Will be on @foxandfriends now.

I will be interviewed from Cleveland, Ohio, on @seanhannity - Tonight at 10:00 P.M. Enjoy!

. @YoungDems4Trump Thank you!

Hopefully the violence & unrest in Charlotte will come to an immediate end. To those injured, get well soon. We need unity & leadership.

The situations in Tulsa and Charlotte are tragic. We must come together to make America safe again.

Hillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest. Sleep well Hillary - see you at the debate!

Heading to North Carolina for two big rallies. Will be there soon. We will bring jobs back where they belong!

Do people notice Hillary is copying my airplane rallies - she puts the plane behind her like I have been doing from the beginning.

Crooked Hillary has been fighting ISIS, or whatever she has been doing, for years. Now she has new ideas. It is time for change.

I will be interviewed on the @oreillyfactor - tonight from Florida, now. Enjoy!

Once again someone we were told is ok turns out to be a terrorist who wants to destroy our country & its people- how did he get thru system?

Great job once again by law enforcement! We are proud of them and should embrace them - without them, we don't have a country!

Will be on @foxandfriends at 7:02 A.M. Enjoy.

Terrible attacks in NY, NJ and MN this weekend. Thinking of victims, their families and all Americans! We need to be strong!

Under the leadership of Obama & Clinton, Americans have experienced more attacks at home than victories abroad. Time to change the playbook!

I would like to express my warmest regards, best wishes and condolences to all of the families and victims of the horrible bombing in NYC.

Never met but never liked dopey Robert Gates. Look at the mess the U.S. is in. Always speaks badly of his many bosses, including Obama.

Heading to Colorado for a big rally. Massive crowd, great people! Will be there soon - the polls are looking good.

My lawyers want to sue the failing @nytimes so badly for irresponsible intent. I said no (for now), but they are watching. Really disgusting

The failing @nytimes has gone nuts that Crooked Hillary is doing so badly. They are willing to say anything, has become a laughingstock rag!

Crazy Maureen Dowd, the wacky columnist for the failing @nytimes , pretends she knows me well--wrong!

Wacky @NYTimesDowd , who hardly knows me, makes up things that I never said for her boring interviews and column. A neurotic dope!

. @CNN just doesn't get it, and that's why their ratings are so low - and getting worse. Boring anti-Trump panelists, mostly losers in life!

I never met former Defense Secretary Robert Gates. He knows nothing about me. But look at the results under his guidance - a total disaster!

Crooked Hillary wants to take your 2nd Amendment rights away. Will guns be taken from her heavily armed Secret Service detail? Maybe not!

Just arrived in Texas - have been informed two @fortworthpd officers have been shot. My thoughts and prayers are with them.

Just leaving Miami for Houston, Oklahoma and Colorado. Miami crowd was fantastic!

I am now going to the brand new Trump International, Hotel D.C. for a major statement.

Will be joining @jimmyfallon on @FallonTonight at 11:35pmE tonight. Enjoy! – bei NBC Studio Tour

I will be interviewed by @jessebwatters on @oreillyfactor tonight at 8pm. Enjoy!

Will be on @foxandfriends at 7:00 A.M. Enjoy!

I was never a fan of Colin Powell after his weak understanding of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq = disaster. We can do much better!

I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends tomorrow at 7am. Enjoy!

Russia took Crimea during the so-called Obama years. Who wouldn't know this and why does Obama get a free pass?

Why isn't President Obama working instead of campaigning for Hillary Clinton?

Just got back from Asheville, North Carolina, where we had a massive rally. The spirit of the crowd was unbelievable. Thank you! #MAGA

Will be on @CNBC at @7 :22. Enjoy!

I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:00 A.M.

The seriously failing @nytimes , despite so much winning and poll numbers that will soon put me in first place, only writes dishonest hits!

Hillary Clinton just had her 47% moment. What a terrible thing she said about so many great Americans!

While Hillary said horrible things about my supporters, and while many of her supporters will never vote for me, I still respect them all!

Really sad that Republicans would allow themselves to be used in a Clinton ad. Lindsey Graham, Romney, Flake, Sass. SUPREME COURT, REMEMBER!

Wow, Hillary Clinton was SO INSULTING to my supporters, millions of amazing, hard working people. I think it will cost her at the Polls!

Will be in Missouri today with Melania for the funeral of a wonderful and truly respected woman, Phyllis S!

Just returned from Pensacola, Florida, where the crowd was incredible.

I havn't seen @tonyschwartz in many years, he hardly knows me. Never liked his style. Super lib, Crooked H supporter. Irrelevant dope!

Dummy writer @tonyschwartz , who wanted to do a second book with me for years (I said no), is now a hostile basket case who feels jilted!

Will be delivering a major speech tonight - live on @oreillyfactor at 8:10pm from Pensacola, Florida.

Henry McMaster, Lt. Governor of South Carolina who endorsed me, beat failed @CNN announcer Bakari Sellers, so badly. Funny!

Jeff Zucker failed @NBC and he is now failing @CNN .

. @CNN is unwatchable. Their news on me is fiction. They are a disgrace to the broadcasting industry and an arm of the Clinton campaign.

The documentary of me that @CNN just aired is a total waste of time. I don't even know many of the people who spoke about me. A joke!

It wasn't Matt Lauer that hurt Hillary last night. It was her very dumb answer about emails & the veteran who said she should be in jail.

With Luis, Mexico and the United States would have made wonderful deals together - where both Mexico and the US would have benefitted.

Mexico has lost a brilliant finance minister and wonderful man who I know is highly respected by President Peña Nieto.

Hillary Clinton answered email questions differently last night than she has in the past. She is totally confused. Unfit to serve as #POTUS .

Hillary just gave a disastrous news conference on the tarmac to make up for poor performance last night. She's being decimated by the media!

"A rough night for Hillary Clinton" ABC News.

Wow, reviews are in - THANK YOU!

COMING UP @GenFlynn @newtgingrich on @foxandfriends

Thank you to @foxandfriends for the nice reviews of last night.

Thank you to our fantastic veterans. The reviews and polls from almost everyone of my Commander-in-Chief presentation were great. Nice!

I will be interviewed on @oreillyfactor tonight at 11pmE @FoxNews . Enjoy!

Mainstream media never covered Hillary’s massive “hacking” or coughing attack, yet it is #1 trending. What’s up?

As a tribute to the late, great Phyllis Schlafly, I hope everybody can go out and get her latest book, THE CONSERVATIVE CASE FOR TRUMP.

China wouldn't provide a red carpet stairway from Air Force One and then Philippines President calls Obama "the son of a whore." Terrible!

The truly great Phyllis Schlafly, who honored me with her strong endorsement for president, has passed away at 92. She was very special!

President Obama & Putin fail to reach deal on Syria - so what else is new? Obama is not a natural deal maker. Only makes bad deals!

"@ronnieclemmons: @ChrisCJackson @TakouiS @realDonaldTrump Trump now leads her by 2 - get real, she will lose big"

Lyin' Hillary Clinton told the FBI that she did not know the "C" markings on documents stood for CLASSIFIED. How can this be happening?

To the African-American community: The Democrats have failed you for fifty years, high crime, poor schools, no jobs. I will fix it, VOTE "T"

The polls are close so Crooked Hillary is getting out of bed and will campaign tomorrow.Why did she hammer 13 devices and acid-wash e-mails?

The Great State of Arizona, where I just had a massive rally (amazing people), has a very weak and ineffective Senator, Jeff Flake. Sad!

The Republican Party needs strong and committed leaders, not weak people such as @JeffFlake , if it is going to stop illegal immigration.

Crooked Hillary's V.P. pick said this morning that I was not aware that Russia took over Crimea. A total lie - and taken over during O term!

Wow, the failing @nytimes has not reported properly on Crooked's FBI release. They are at the back of the pack - no longer a credible source

. @CNN is so disgusting in their bias, but they are having a hard time promoting Crooked Hillary in light of the new e-mail scandals.

Great visit to Detroit church, fantastic reception, and all @CNN talks about is a small protest outside. Inside a large and wonderful crowd!

I visited our Trump Tower campaign headquarters last night, after returning from Ohio and Arizona, and it was packed with great pros - WIN!

People will be very surprised by our ground game on Nov. 8. We have an army of volunteers and people with GREAT SPIRIT! They want to #MAGA !

Just heard that crazy and very dumb @morningmika had a mental breakdown while talking about me on the low ratings @Morning_Joe . Joe a mess!

I will be interviewed by @ericbolling tonight at 8pm on the @oreillyfactor . Enjoy!

Poll numbers way up - making big progress!

Thank you to @foxandfriends for the great review of the speech on immigration last night. Thank you also to the great people of Arizona!

Mexico will pay for the wall!

Great trip to Mexico today - wonderful leadership and high quality people! Look forward to our next meeting.

Hillary Clinton didn't go to Louisiana, and now she didn't go to Mexico. She doesn't have the drive or stamina to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Former President Vicente Fox, who is railing against my visit to Mexico today, also invited me when he apologized for using the "f bomb."

I have accepted the invitation of President Enrique Pena Nieto, of Mexico, and look very much forward to meeting him tomorrow.

From day one I said that I was going to build a great wall on the SOUTHERN BORDER, and much more. Stop illegal immigration. Watch Wednesday!

Now that African-Americans are seeing what a bad job Hillary type policy and management has done to the inner-cities, they want TRUMP!

Crooked Hillary's brainpower is highly overrated.Probably why her decision making is so bad or, as stated by Bernie S, she has BAD JUDGEMENT

Does anyone know that Crooked Hillary, who tried so hard, was unable to pass the Bar Exams in Washington D.C. She was forced to go elsewhere

Inner-city crime is reaching record levels. African-Americans will vote for Trump because they know I will stop the slaughter going on!

Look how bad it is getting! How much more crime, how many more shootings, will it take for African-Americans and Latinos to vote Trump=SAFE!

I will be making a major speech on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION on Wednesday in the GREAT State of Arizona. Big crowds, looking for a larger venue.

I think that both candidates, Crooked Hillary and myself, should release detailed medical records. I have no problem in doing so! Hillary?

Today is the 53rd anniversary of the March on Washington - today we honor the enduring fight for justice, equality and opportunity.

Just landed in Iowa to attend a great event in honor of wonderful Senator @JoniErnst . Look forward to being with all of my friends.

My condolences to Dwyane Wade and his family, on the loss of Nykea Aldridge. They are in my thoughts and prayers.

Dwyane Wade's cousin was just shot and killed walking her baby in Chicago. Just what I have been saying. African-Americans will VOTE TRUMP!

Heroin overdoses are taking over our children and others in the MIDWEST. Coming in from our southern border. We need strong border & WALL!

Will be in Phoenix, Arizona on Wednesday. Changing venue to much larger one. Demand is unreal. Polls looking great! #ImWithYou

I will be interviewed by @kimguilfoyle at 7pm on @FoxNews . #Enjoy !

How quickly people forget that Crooked Hillary called African-American youth "SUPER PREDATORS" - Has she apologized?

I am very proud to have brought the subject of illegal immigration back into the discussion. Such a big problem for our country-I will solve

Wonderful @pastormarkburns was attacked viciously and unfairly on @MSNBC by crazy @morningmika on low ratings @Morning_Joe . Apologize!

What do African-Americans and Hispanics have to lose by going with me. Look at the poverty, crime and educational statistics. I will fix it!

Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to solve the problems of poverty, education and safety within the African-American & Hispanic communities

Hillary Clinton only knows how to make a speech when it is a hit on me. No policy, and always very short (stamina). Media gives her a pass!

Hillary Clinton is using race-baiting to try to get African-American voters- but they know she is all talk and NO ACTION!

Hillary Clinton's short speech is pandering to the worst instincts in our society. She should be ashamed of herself!

Just watched recap of #CrookedHillary 's speech. Very short and lies. She is the only one fear-mongering!

So many in the African-American community are doing so badly, poverty and crime way up, employment and jobs way down: I will fix it, promise

Poll numbers are starting to look very good. Leading in Florida @CNN Arizona and big jump in Utah. All numbers rising, national way up. Wow!

Thoughts and prayers to the great people of Indiana. You will prevail!

Great Governor @Mike_Pence is in Indiana to help lead the relief efforts after tornadoes struck. True leadership.

Will be on #Hannity @10pE @FoxNews - discussing various subjects including immigration-if elected, we will #BuildTheWall & enforce our laws!

My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and families of those affected by two powerful earthquakes in Italy and Myanmar.

President Obama should have gone to Louisiana days ago, instead of golfing. Too little, too late!

Hillary Clinton strongly stated that there was "absolutely no connection" between her private work and that of The State Department. LIE!

It is being reported by virtually everyone, and is a fact, that the media pile on against me is the worst in American political history!

I am now in Texas doing a big fundraiser for the Republican Party and a @FoxNews Special on the BORDER and with victims of border crime!

The @WashingtonPost quickly put together a hit job book on me- comprised of copies of some of their inaccurate stories. Don't buy, boring!

. @AnnCoulter 's new book, 'In Trump We Trust, comes out tomorrow. People are saying it's terrific - knowing Ann I am sure it is!

Just leaving Akron, Ohio, after a packed rally. Amazing people! Going now to Texas.

Will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:30 A.M. Eastern. ENJOY!

Some day, when things calm down, I'll tell the real story of @JoeNBC and his very insecure long-time girlfriend, @morningmika . Two clowns!

Tried watching low-rated @Morning_Joe this morning, unwatchable! @morningmika is off the wall, a neurotic and not very bright mess!

I heard that @Morning_Joe was very nice on Friday but that little Donny D, a big failure in TV (& someone I helped), was nasty. Irrelevant!

Crooked Hillary is flooding the airwaves with false and misleading ads - all paid for by her bosses on Wall Street. Media is protecting her!

I have been drawing very big and enthusiastic crowds, but the media refuses to show or discuss them. Something very big is happening!

We will bring America together as ONE country again – united as Americans in common purpose and common dreams. #MAGA

Will be interviewed on @JudgeJeanine at 9:00 P.M. Enjoy!

Just leaving Virginia - really big crowd, great enthusiasm!

#WheresHillary ? Sleeping!!!!!

Great job by @EricTrump on interview with @BillHemmer on @FoxNews . #ImWithYou #TrumpTrain

Thank you to everyone for all of the nice comments, by Twitter, pundits and otherwise for my speech last night.

The reporting at the failing @nytimes gets worse and worse by the day. Fortunately, it is a dying newspaper.

Thank you to NC for last evenings great reception. The speech was a great success. Heading now to Louisiana & another speech tonight in MI.

They will soon be calling me MR. BREXIT!

I will be doing a Town Hall tonight at 10:00 P.M. on @seanhannity - @FoxNews

Will be on @SeanHannity tonight at 10pmE - delivering an important speech live from Wisconsin. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Court get proper appointments. Sad!

"Stay on message" is the chant. I always do - trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd A, repeal Ocare, borders, etc - but media misrepresents!

I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!

It is not "freedom of the press" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!

I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose!

My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.

If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20%

The failing @nytimes , which never spoke to me, keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False, I am who I am-never said

The failing @nytimes talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened. Their reporting is fiction. The media protects Hillary!

"@zulu_out: You are a man for the people because you know what it is like to be among the people #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #USA Loves U" Thanks

We now have confirmation as to one reason Crooked H wanted to be sure that nobody saw her e-mails - PAY-FOR-PLAY. How can she run for Pres.

I am truly enjoying myself while running for president. The people of our country are amazing - great numbers on November 8th!

The failing @nytimes has become a newspaper of fiction. Their stories about me always quote non-existent unnamed sources. Very dishonest!

Will be on @seanhannity tonight at 10pm, hosted by @GovMikeHuckabee . Enjoy!

ISIS gained tremendous strength during Hillary Clinton's term as Secretary of State. When will the dishonest media report the facts!

I love watching these poor, pathetic people (pundits) on television working so hard and so seriously to try and figure me out. They can't!

A massive tax increase will be necessary to fund Crooked Hillary Clinton's agenda. What a terrible (and boring) rollout that was yesterday!

Ratings challenged @CNN reports so seriously that I call President Obama (and Clinton) "the founder" of ISIS, & MVP. THEY DON'T GET SARCASM?

Will be doing @oreillyfactor tonight at 8pm. Enjoy!

Great job today by the NYPD in protecting the people and saving the climber.

Reuters just announced that Secret Service never spoke to me or my campaign. Made up story by @CNN is a hoax. Totally dishonest.

No such meeting or conversation ever happened - a made up story by "low ratings" @CNN .

My thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers shot in Sebastian County, Arkansas. #LESM

Morning Joe's weakness is its low ratings. I don't watch anymore but I heard he went wild against Rudy Giuliani and #2A - sad & irrelevant!

. @dbongino You were fantastic in defending both the Second Amendment and me last night on @CNN . Don Lemon is a lightweight - dumb as a rock

Media desperate to distract from Clinton's anti-2A stance. I said pro-2A citizens must organize and get out vote to save our Constitution!

When is the media going to talk about Hillary's policies that have gotten people killed, like Libya, open borders, and maybe her emails?

"@LinHen23: @foxandfriends Loved Trump's answers to voters questions this morning! Trump's economic plan will help #MAGA #NeverHillary "

I am running against the Washington insiders, just like I did in the Republican Primaries. These are the people that have made U.S. a mess!

Will be interviewed on @foxandfriends now!

Being in Detroit today was wonderful. Quick stop in Ohio to meet with some of our great supporters. Just got back home!

Many people are saying that the Iranians killed the scientist who helped the U.S. because of Hillary Clinton's hacked emails.

My economic policy speech will be carried live at 12:15 P.M. Enjoy!

Michael Morell, the lightweight former Acting Director of C.I.A., and a man who has made serious bad calls, is a total Clinton flunky!

The media is going crazy. They totally distort so many things on purpose. Crimea, nuclear, "the baby" and so much more. Very dishonest!

I see where Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake of Baltimore is pushing Crooked hard. Look at the job she has done in Baltimore. She is a joke!

I am not just running against Crooked Hillary Clinton, I am running against the very dishonest and totally biased media - but I will win!

Heading to New Hampshire - will be talking about Hillary saying her brain SHORT CIRCUITED, and other things!

Anybody whose mind "SHORT CIRCUITS" is not fit to be our president! Look up the word "BRAINWASHED."

Crooked Hillary said loudly, and for the world to see, that she "SHORT CIRCUITED" when answering a question on her e-mails. Very dangerous!

Hillary Clinton is being badly criticized for her poor performance in answering questions. Let us all see what happens!

The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva, Switzerland, not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran!

Obama's disastrous judgment gave us ISIS, rise of Iran, and the worst economic numbers since the Great Depression!

President Obama should ask the DNC about how they rigged the election against Bernie.

Our incompetent Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, was the one who started talks to give 400 million dollars, in cash, to Iran. Scandal!

There is great unity in my campaign, perhaps greater than ever before. I want to thank everyone for your tremendous support. Beat Crooked H!

Great day in Virginia. Crowd was fantastic!

President Obama will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States!

Vast numbers of manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania have moved to Mexico and other countries. That will end when I win!

Thanks to @pnehlen for your kind words, very much appreciated.

When will CNN do a segment on Hillary’s plan to increase Syrian refugees 550% and how much it will cost?

Hillary Clinton raked in money from regimes that horribly oppress women and gays & refuses to speak out against Radical Islam.

People believe CNN these days almost as little as they believe Hillary....that's really saying something!

The people who support Hillary sit behind CNN anchor chairs, or headline fundraisers - those disconnected from real life.

Will CNN send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding -- or are they worried it will hurt Hillary?

When will we see stories from CNN on Clinton Foundation corruption and Hillary's pay-for-play at State Department?

CNN anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime, failing schools and vanishing jobs.

CNN will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for Hillary Clinton.

So with all of the Obama tough talk on Russia and the Ukraine, they have already taken Crimea and continue to push. That's what I said!

When I said in an interview that Putin is "not going into Ukraine, you can mark it down," I am saying if I am President. Already in Crimea!

This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart!

Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice!

Wow, it is unbelievable how distorted, one-sided and biased the media is against us. The failing @nytimes is a joke. @CNN is laughable!

The dishonest media is fawning over the Democratic Convention. I wonder why, then, my speech had millions of more viewers than Crooked H?

I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me!

Captain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our "leaders" to eradicate it!

Nielson Media Research final numbers on ACCEPTANCE SPEECH: TRUMP 32.2 MILLION. CLINTON 27.8 MILLION. Thank you!

Thank you to all of the television viewers that made my speech at the Republican National Convention #1 over Crooked Hillary and DEMS.

Can you imagine if I had the small crowds that Hillary is drawing today in Pennsylvania. It would be a major media event! @CNN @FoxNews

Wow, NATO's top commander just announced that he agrees with me that alliance members must PAY THEIR BILLS. This is a general I will like!

The "Rust Belt" was created by politicians like the Clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like Mexico. END!

Crooked's stop in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians, drew less than 200 - with Bill, VP

Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA?

I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better!

Why doesn't the media want to report that on the two "Big Thursdays" when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republican's won ratings

Crooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime, supports open borders, and wants massive tax hikes. A formula for disaster!

Violent crime is rising across the United States, yet the DNC convention ignored it. Crime reduction will be one of my top priorities.

Just got back from Colorado. The love and enthusiasm at two rallies was incredible. Big crowds!

We are suffering through the worst long-term unemployment in the last 70 years. I want change - Crooked Hillary Clinton does not.

Hillary can never win over Bernie supporters. Her foreign wars, NAFTA/TPP support & Wall Street ties are driving away millions of votes.

Colorado was amazing yesterday! So much support. Our tax, trade and energy reforms will bring great jobs to Colorado and the whole country.

As usual, Hillary & the Dems are trying to rig the debates so 2 are up against major NFL games. Same as last time w/ Bernie. Unacceptable!

Hillary Clinton should not be given national security briefings in that she is a lose cannon with extraordinarily bad judgement & insticts.

I am watching Crooked Hillary speak. Same old stuff, our country needs change!

Wow, my campaign is hearing from more and more Bernie supporters that they will NEVER support Crooked Hillary. She sold them out, V.P. pick!

The dishonest media didn't mention that Bernie Sanders was very angry looking during Crooked's speech. He wishes he didn't make that deal!

Crooked Hillary said that I "couldn't handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign." Really,I just beat 16 people and am beating her!

If Michael Bloomberg ran again for Mayor of New York, he wouldn't get 10% of the vote - they would run him out of town! #NeverHillary

"Little" Michael Bloomberg, who never had the guts to run for president, knows nothing about me. His last term as Mayor was a disaster!

General John Allen, who I never met but spoke against me last night, failed badly in his fight against ISIS. His record = BAD #NeverHillary

Crooked Hillary Clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech. Many of her statements were lies and fabrications!

Two policemen just shot in San Diego, one dead. It is only getting worse. People want LAW AND ORDER!

Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me, and "forgot" to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream!

The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke. @CNN and the little watched @Morning_Joe = SAD!

No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes.

Hillary's wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world.

Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety.

Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street!

Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.

Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.

Median household income is down for the middle class since Obama took office. It will only go further down under Clinton.

A vote for Clinton-Kaine is a vote for TPP, NAFTA, high taxes, radical regulation, and massive influx of refugees.

President Obama spoke last night about a world that doesn’t exist. 70% of the people think our country is going in the wrong direction. #DNC

Our country does not feel 'great already' to the millions of wonderful people living in poverty, violence and despair.

Shooting deaths of police officers up 78% this year. We must restore law and order and protect our great law enforcement officers!

If Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clinton's 33,000 illegally deleted emails, perhaps they should share them with the FBI!

Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic

Our not very bright Vice President, Joe Biden, just stated that I wanted to "carpet bomb" the enemy. Sorry Joe, that was Ted Cruz!

Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!

Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough!

The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD!

Funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said "Trump is a genius." America 1st!

As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv.

Many of Bernie's supporters have left the arena. Did Bernie go home and go to sleep?

I hate to say it, but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention!

No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated!

You have no idea what my strategy on ISIS is, and neither does ISIS (a good thing). Please get your facts straight - thanks. @megynkelly

For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia.

In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster, the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump. Crazy!

Dems don't want to talk ISIS b/c Hillary's foreign interventions unleashed ISIS & her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here.

Bernie's exhausted, he just wants to shut down and go home to bed!

The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar!

Pocahontas bombed last night! Sad to watch.

Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order. The Republican Convention was great

Funny, if you listen to @FoxNews , the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two, they are fawning. What a difference

Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time.

Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated!

Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.

If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself.

I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing. He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air!

Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke!

While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.

Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP, is in pocket of Wall Street, and backed Iraq War.

Great POLL numbers are coming out all over. People don't want another four years of Obama, and Crooked Hillary would be even worse. #MAGA

The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE!

Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!

Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance!

Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her "servant" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all! They laughed at Bernie.

If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same.

Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!

How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie!

The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me

Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS & all others laughing!

The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you!

The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out!

The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well!

Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!

Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out

If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild

The @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!

I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left!

Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz ( @DWStweets .)

Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!

There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution." He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!

An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.

Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!

Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!

Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT

The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!

Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night. From the heart!

The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud!

Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me!

I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!

Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!

Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!

Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.

Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED

Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her!

Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!

The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight?

I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam.

Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did?

Another attack, this time in Germany. Many killed. God bless the people of Munich.

One of the best produced, including the incredible stage & set, in the history of conventions. Great unity! Big T.V. ratings! @KarlRove

Thank you Cleveland. We love you and will be back many times!

What a great four days in Cleveland. So proud of the great job done by the RNC and all. The police and Secret Service were fantastic!

Other than a small group of people who have suffered massive and embarrassing losses, the party is VERY united. Great love in the arena!

Ted Cruz talks about the Constitution but doesn't say that if the Dems win the Presidency, the new JUSTICES appointed will destroy us all!

I am soooo proud of my children, Don, Eric and Tiffany - their speeches, under enormous pressure, were incredible. Ivanka intros me tonight!

Arena was packed, totally electric!

. @mike_pence was fantastic tonight. Will be a great V.P.

Wow, Ted Cruz got booed off the stage, didn't honor the pledge! I saw his speech two hours early but let him speak anyway. No big deal!

Thank you to Governor @ScottWalker for such warm support. Great speech!

Watching the #GOPConvention #AmericaFirst #RNCinCLE

John Kasich was never asked by me to be V.P. Just arrived in Cleveland - will be a great two days!

The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania's speech than the FBI spent on Hillary's emails.

Good news is Melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press!

In November, I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state. Jobs!

Bill Hemmer of @FoxNews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena. More than in past years.

Congratulations to my children, Don and Tiffany, on having done a fantastic job last night. I am very proud of you!

Such a great honor to be the Republican Nominee for President of the United States. I will work hard and never let you down! AMERICA FIRST!

The ROLL CALL is beginning at the Republican National Convention. Very exciting!

"@RoxaneTancredi: Democrats are coming to TRUMP. I used to be proud of the dem party. No more It is crooked and not for the people."

It was truly an honor to introduce my wife, Melania. Her speech and demeanor were absolutely incredible. Very proud! #GOPConvention

Will be on @OreillyFactor tonight at 8:30pm @FoxNews - prior to Melania's speech at the #GOPConvention . Tune in- she will do great! #RNCinCLE

Networks other than low ratings @CNN have been very fair and exciting!

. @CNN is the worst.They go to their dumb, one-sided panels when a podium speaker is for Trump! VAST MAJORITY want: Make America Great Again!

Looking forward to being at the convention tonight to watch all of the wonderful speakers including my wife, Melania. Place looks beautiful!

President Obama just had a news conference, but he doesn't have a clue. Our country is a divided crime scene, and it will only get worse!

Our country is totally divided and our enemies are watching. We are not looking good, we are not looking smart, we are not looking tough!

I will be on @60Minutes tonight at 7:00 P.M. with Mike Pence talking about LAW AND ORDER and many other subjects! Bad times for divided USA!

We are TRYING to fight ISIS, and now our own people are killing our police. Our country is divided and out of control. The world is watching

The ratings at @FoxNews blow away the ratings of @CNN - not even close. That's because CNN is the Clinton News Network and people don't like

. @FoxNews is much better, and far more truthful, than @CNN , which is all negative. Guests are stacked for Crooked Hillary! I don't watch.

If Goofy Elizabeth Warren, a very weak Senator, didn't lie about her heritage (being Native American) she would be nothing today. Pick her H

I hope that Crooked Hillary picks Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, as her V.P. Then we can litigate her fraud!

It doesn't matter that Crooked Hillary has experience, look at all of the bad decisions she has made. Bernie said she has bad judgement!

As the days and weeks go by, we see what a total mess our country (and world) is in - Crooked Hillary Clinton led Obama into bad decisions!

We are going to have a great time in Cleveland. Will lead to special results for our country. We will Make America Great Again!

Goofy Elizabeth Warren, who may be the least productive Senator in the U.S. Senate, must prove she is not a fraud. Without the con it's over

Thank you to Jack Morgan, Tamara Neo, Cheryl Ann Kraft and all of my friends and supporters in Virginia. GREAT JOB!

Thank you to Chris Cox and Bikers for Trump - Your support has been amazing. I will never forget. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for by Wall Street, lobbyists and special interests. She will sell our country down the tubes!

Very sad that a person who has made so many mistakes, Crooked Hillary Clinton, can put out such false and vicious ads with her phony money!

Crooked Hillary, who embarrassed herself and the country with her e-mail lies, has been a DISASTER on foreign policy. Look what's happening!

Crooked Hillary is spending big Wall Street money on ads saying I don't have foreign policy experience, yet look what her policies have done

Look forward to introducing Governor Mike Pence (who has done a spectacular job in the great State of Indiana). My first choice from start!

Look forward to Governor Mike Pence V.P. introduction tomorrow in New York City.

I am pleased to announce that I have chosen Governor Mike Pence as my Vice Presidential running mate. News conference tomorrow at 11:00 A.M.

Four more years of weakness with a Crooked Hillary Administration is not acceptable. Look what has happened to the world with O & Hillary!

#NeverTrump is never more. They were crushed last night in Cleveland at Rules Committee by a vote of 87-12. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

My prayers and condolences to the victims and families of the terrible tragedy in Nice, France. We are with you in every way!

In light of the horrible attack in Nice, France, I have postponed tomorrow's news conference concerning my Vice Presidential announcement.

Another horrific attack, this time in Nice, France. Many dead and injured. When will we learn? It is only getting worse.

I employ many people in the State of Virginia - JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! Crooked Hillary will sell us out, just like her husband did with NAFTA.

I will be making the announcement of my Vice Presidential pick on Friday at 11am in Manhattan. Details to follow.

If I win the Presidency, we will swamp Justice Ginsburg with real judges and real legal opinions!

Even the @NYTimes and @WashingtonPost Editorial Boards condemned Justice Ginsburg for her ethical and legal breach. What was she thinking?

Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct? Big mistake by an incompetent judge!

On my way to San Diego to raise money for the Republican Party. I am spending a lot myself and also helping others.

Voters understand that Crooked Hillary's negative ads are not true- just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity.

Despite spending $500k a day on TV ads alone #CrookedHillary falls flat in nationwide @QuinnipiacPoll . Having ZERO impact. Sad!!

Is President Obama trying to destroy Israel with all his bad moves? Think about it and let me know!

The Republican platform is most pro-Israel of all time!

New GOP platform now includes language that supports the border wall. We will build the wall and MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!

Justice Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me. Her mind is shot - resign!

I will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight on @FoxNews at 8pm. Enjoy!

To all the Bernie voters who want to stop bad trade deals & global special interests, we welcome you with open arms. People first.

Bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro-war pro-TPP pro-Wall Street Crooked Hillary Clinton.

Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs.

I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters. They are not happy that he is selling out!

Bernie Sanders, who has lost most of his leverage, has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. He will endorse her today - fans angry!

This election is a choice between law, order & safety - or chaos, crime & violence. I will make America safe again for everyone. #ImWithYou

For too many years, our inner cities have been left behind. I am going to deliver jobs, safety and protection for those in need.

Crime is out of control, and rapidly getting worse. Look what is going on in Chicago and our inner cities. Not good!

Thoughts and prayers with the victims, and their families- along with everyone at the Berrien County Courthouse in St. Joseph, Michigan.

I heard that the underachieving John King of @CNN on Inside Politics was one hour of lies. Happily, few people are watching - dead network!

The media is so dishonest. If I make a statement, they twist it and turn it to make it sound bad or foolish.They think the public is stupid!

President Obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think. He is living in a world of the make believe!

Look what is happening to our country under the WEAK leadership of Obama and people like Crooked Hillary Clinton. We are a divided nation!

Way to go @serenawilliams - you are a true champion. Proud of you!

Isn't it sad that on a day of national tragedy Hillary Clinton is answering softball questions about her email lies on @CNN ?

Due to the horrific events taking place in our country, I have decided to postpone my speech on economic opportunity- today in Miami.

Prayers and condolences to all of the families who are so thoroughly devastated by the horrors we are all watching take place in our country

After today, Crooked Hillary can officially be called Lyin' Crooked Hillary.

Just leaving D.C. Had great meetings with Republicans in the House and Senate. Very interesting day! These are people who love our country!

Convention speaker schedule to be released tomorrow. Let today be devoted to Crooked Hillary and the rigged system under which we live.

I have over seven million hits on social media re Crooked Hillary Clinton. Check it out Sleepy Eyes, @MarkHalperin @NBCPolitics

Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd, a man with so little touch for politics, is at it again.He could not have watched my standing ovation speech in N.C.

Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in A.C. Others to follow. Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City.

Hillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves - Convention Center, Airport - and destroyed City

I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago, great timing (as all know). Pols made big mistakes, now many bankruptcies.

Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country. She is sooooo guilty. But watch, her time will come!

Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest, incompetent and of very bad judgement.

Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team "were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information." Not fit!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT!

I don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with "murder." Come November 8, she's out!

Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party. There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. Lots of support! Win

I will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight on @FoxNews at 11pm. Enjoy!

My son, @EricTrump will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight at 10pm on @FoxNews . Enjoy!

Looking forward to meeting with @SenBobCorker in a little while. We will be traveling to North Carolina together today.

FBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security. No charges. Wow! #RiggedSystem

The system is rigged. General Petraeus got in trouble for far less. Very very unfair! As usual, bad judgment.

It was great spending time with @joniernst yesterday. She has done a fantastic job for the people of Iowa and U.S. Will see her again!

Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary. A total disgrace!

On @FoxNews at 7:00 P.M. "Special: Meet the Trumps" Hope you enjoy!

Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays?

With Hillary and Obama, the terrorist attacks will only get worse. Politically correct fools, won't even call it what it is - RADICAL ISLAM!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is "guilty as hell" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! Where are the 33,000 missing e-mails?

The only people who are not interested in being the V.P. pick are the people who have not been asked!

I look forward to meeting @joniernst today in New Jersey. She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa!

Spent time with Indiana Governor Mike Pence and family yesterday. Very impressed, great people!

Senator Tom Cotton was great on Meet the Press yesterday. Despite a totally one-sided interview by Chuck Todd, the end result was solid!

Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff's Star, or plain star!

Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to handle the complexities and danger of ISIS - it will just go on forever. We need change!

The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS. 200 dead in Baghdad, worst in many years. We do not have leadership that can stop this!

In Bangladesh, hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran. 20 were killed!

I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught!

The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting "go away, no pictures."

Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about "grandkids" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac?

"THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!"

On Saturday a great man, Elie Wiesel, passed away.The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil!

Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged & corrupt!

Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know.

Just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd, and the entire show, is against me.The good news-the people get it!

It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said, the system is totally rigged!

It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!

The speakers slots at the Republican Convention are totally filled, with a long waiting list of those that want to speak - Wednesday release

Just read in the failing @nytimes that I was not aware "the event had to be held in Cleveland" - a total lie. These people are sick!

Just returned from Colorado. Amazing crowd!

. @TraceAdkins great job on FOX this morning. Keep up the good work!

Take a look at what happened w/ Bill Clinton. The system is totally rigged. Does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence?

Bill Clinton's meeting was a total secret. Nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter.

As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgement. Bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by Hillary!

I will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight at 10pm on FOX! Enjoy!

The reason I put up approximately $50 million for my successful primary campaign is very simple, I want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx. $50 million loan. I have totally terminated the loan!

The very dishonest @NBCNews refuses to accept the fact that I have forgiven my $50 million loan to my campaign. Done deal!

New book by @ericbolling is absolutely terrific and a must read! #WakeUpAmerica

For reasons only they can explain, the @USChamber wants to continue our bad trade deals rather than renegotiating and making them better.

Tremendous day in Massachusetts and Maine. Thank you to everyone for making it so special!

I will be on @oreillyfactor at 8:00 P.M. Enjoy!

ISIS exploded on Hillary Clinton's watch- she's done nothing about it and never will. Not capable!

Just watched Senator John Barrasso on @FoxNews - He was great! Thank you John.

Why would the USChamber be upset by the fact that I want to negotiate better and stronger trade deals or that I want penalties for cheaters?

The @USCHAMBER must fight harder for the American worker. China, and many others, are taking advantage of U.S. with our terrible trade pacts

Iron Mike Tyson was not asked to speak at the Convention though I'm sure he would do a good job if he was. The media makes everything up!

We must do everything possible to keep this horrible terrorism outside the United States.

Yet another terrorist attack, this time in Turkey. Will the world ever realize what is going on? So sad.

Hillary Clinton’s Presidency would be catastrophic for the future of our country. She is ill-fit with bad judgment.

Benghazi is just another Hillary Clinton failure. It just never seems to work the way it's supposed to with Clinton.

. @CNN is all negative when it comes to me. I don't watch it anymore.

The media is unrelenting. They will only go with and report a story in a negative light. I called Brexit (Hillary was wrong), watch November

Crooked Hillary is wheeling out one of the least productive senators in the U.S. Senate, goofy Elizabeth Warren, who lied on heritage.

The "dirty" poll done by @ABC @washingtonpost is a disgrace. Even they admit that many more Democrats were polled. Other polls were good.

Crooked Hillary Clinton got Brexit wrong. I said LEAVE will win. She has no sense of markets and such bad judgement. Only a question of time

Hillary Clinton is not a change agent, just the same old status quo! She is spending a fortune, I am spending very little. Close in polls!

People in our country want borders, and without them the old line pols like Crooked Hillary will not win. It is time for CHANGE -- and JOBS!

The @ABC poll sample is heavy on Democrats. Very dishonest - why would they do that? Other polls good!

Crooked Hillary just took a major ad of me playing golf at Turnberry. Shows me hitting shot, but I never did = lie! Was there to support son

Clinton is trying to wash away her bad judgement call on BREXIT with big dollar ads. Disgraceful!

Crooked Hillary Clinton, who called BREXIT 100% wrong (along with Obama), is now spending Wall Street money on an ad on my correct call.

George Will, one of the most overrated political pundits (who lost his way long ago), has left the Republican Party.He's made many bad calls

Just landed in New York - a one night stay in Scotland. Turnberry came out magnificently. My son, Eric, did a great job - under budget!

Obama has blocked ICE officers and BP from doing their jobs. That ends when I am President!

I have never liked the media term 'mass deportation' -- but we must enforce the laws of the land!

We only want to admit those who love our people and support our values. #AmericaFirst

We must suspend immigration from regions linked with terrorism until a proven vetting method is in place.

So funny, Crooked Hillary called BREXIT so incorrectly, and now she says that she is the one to deal with the U.K. All talk, no action!

Thoughts and prayers are with everyone in West Virginia- dealing with the devastating floods. #ImWithYou

Many people are equating BREXIT, and what is going on in Great Britain, with what is happening in the U.S. People want their country back!

The opening of Trump Turnberry in Scotland was a big success. Good timing, I was here for BREXIT. Very exciting news conference today!

Crooked Hillary called it totally wrong on BREXIT - she went with Obama - and now she is saying we need her to lead. She would be a disaster

America is proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder w/a free & ind UK. We stand together as friends, as allies, & as a people w/a shared history.

Self-determination is the sacred right of all free people's, and the people of the UK have exercised that right for all the world to see.

Getting ready to open the magnificent Turnberry in Scotland. What a great day, especially when added to the brave & brilliant vote.

Just arrived in Scotland. Place is going wild over the vote. They took their country back, just like we will take America back. No games!

Congratulations to my son, Eric, on the fantastic job he has done in rebuilding Turnberry, and its great Ailsa Course. Always support kids!

Leaving now for a one night trip to Scotland in order to be at the Grand Opening of my great Turnberry Resort. Will be back on Sat. night!

Our inner cities have been left behind. We will never have the resources to support our people if we have an open border.

On immigration, I’m consulting with our immigration officers & our wage-earners. Hillary Clinton is consulting with Wall Street.

Obama & Clinton should stop meeting with special interests, & start meeting with the victims of illegal immigration.

Hillary Clinton’s open borders are tearing American families apart. I am going to make our country Safe Again for all Americans. #Imwithyou

SC has kept us safe from exec amnesty--for now. But Hillary has pledged to expand it, taking jobs from Hispanic & African-American workers.

ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made along with President Obama." -- Donald J. Trump

"Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency." -- Donald J. Trump

Thank you to Donald Rumsfeld for the endorsement. Very much appreciated. Clinton's conduct has been "disqualifying."

"@AllegrettiVicki: You have great children, future presidents...and we all see were raised right and out there for their father." Thank you.

Hillary says things can't change. I say they have to change. It's a choice between Americanism and her corrupt globalism. #Imwithyou

Crooked Hillary refuses to say that she will be raising taxes beyond belief! She will be a disaster for jobs and the economy!

I will be interviewed by @LouDobbs tonight on @FoxBusiness 7pm ET

Hillary defrauded America as Secy of State. She used it as a personal hedge fund to get herself rich! Corrupt, dangerous, dishonest.

If you want to know about Hillary Clinton's honesty & judgment, ask the family of Ambassador Stevens.

Hillary took money and did favors for regimes that enslave women and murder gays.

I am "the king of debt."That has been great for me as a businessman, but is bad for the country. I made a fortune off of debt, will fix U.S.

Hillary Clinton's open borders immigration policies will drive down wages for all Americans - and make everyone less safe.

How can Hillary run the economy when she can't even send emails without putting entire nation at risk?

Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% as Secretary of State, costing Americans millions of jobs.

Hillary says this election is about judgment. She's right. Her judgement has killed thousands, unleashed ISIS and wrecked the economy.

I will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton.

Crooked Hillary Clinton is totally unfit to be our president-really bad judgement and a temperament, according to new book, which is a mess!

When I said that if, within the Orlando club, you had some people with guns, I was obviously talking about additional guards or employees

. @DJohnsonPGA We are so proud of you Dustin. Your reaction under pressure was amazing. First of many Majors. You are a true CHAMPION!

How can the NY Times show an empty room hours before my speech even started when they knew it was going to be packed? So totally dishonest!

In Las Vegas, getting ready to speak!

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!

People very unhappy with Crooked Hillary and Obama on JOBS and SAFETY! Biggest trade deficit in many years! More attacks will follow Orlando

Amazing crowd last night in Dallas - more spirit and passion than ever before. Today, all over the great State of Texas!

I will be interviewed on @greta at 7:00 P.M. @FoxNews

I will be meeting with the NRA, who has endorsed me, about not allowing people on the terrorist watch list, or the no fly list, to buy guns.

The press is so totally biased that we have no choice but to take our tough but fair and smart message directly to the people!

Thank you to the LGBT community! I will fight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs.

AMERICA FIRST!

American must now get very tough, very smart and very vigilant. We cannot admit people into our country without extraordinary screening.

In my speech on protecting America I spoke about a temporary ban, which includes suspending immigration from nations tied to Islamic terror.

Congratulations to the 2016 #StanleyCup Champions, Pittsburgh @Penguins !

I am watching @FoxNews and how fairly they are treating me and my words, and @CNN , and the total distortion of my words and what I am saying

I will be going to New Hampshire today, home of my first primary victory, to discuss terror and the horrible events of yesterday. 2:30 P.M.

I have been hitting Obama and Crooked Hillary hard on not using the term Radical Islamic Terror. Hillary just broke-said she would now use!

What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough

Reporting that Orlando killer shouted "Allah hu Akbar!" as he slaughtered clubgoers. 2nd man arrested in LA with rifles near Gay parade.

Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism? If he doesn't he should immediately resign in disgrace!

Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart!

Horrific incident in FL. Praying for all the victims & their families. When will this stop? When will we get tough, smart & vigilant?

Clinton made a false ad about me where I was imitating a reporter GROVELING after he changed his story. I would NEVER mock disabled. Shame!

Really bad shooting in Orlando. Police investigating possible terrorism. Many people dead and wounded.

Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, pretended to be a Native American in order to advance her career. Very racist!

Sad case- @USATODAY did article saying I don't pay bills- false, only don't pay when work is shoddy, bad, or not done! They should do same!

Don King, and so many other African Americans who know me well and endorsed me, would not have done so if they thought I was a racist!

Mitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog. Now he calls me racist-but I am least racist person there is

Heading to D.C. to speak at Faith and Freedom Coalition and visit OPO.

The great boxing promoter, Don King, just endorsed me. Nice!

Pocahontas is at it again! Goofy Elizabeth Warren, one of the least productive U.S. Senators, has a nasty mouth. Hope she is V.P. choice.

Obama just endorsed Crooked Hillary. He wants four more years of Obama—but nobody else does!

Crooked Hillary Clinton will be a disaster on jobs, the economy, trade, healthcare, the military, guns and just about all else. Obama plus!

As expected, the media is very much against me. Their dishonesty is amazing but, just like our big wins in the primaries, we will win!

Bernie Sanders must really dislike Crooked Hillary after the way she played him. Many of his supporters, because of trade, will come to me.

"@Dale_Dangler: @realDonaldTrump You will be the greatest president the world has ever seen" Thanks.

I would have had many millions of votes more than Crooked Hillary Clinton except for the fact that I had 16 opponents, she had one!

"@setfire2flames: Senator Sanders spent more than @realDonaldTrump yet lost."

Nobody is watching @Morning_Joe anymore. Gone off the deep end - bad ratings. You won't believe what I am watching now!

Thank you to all for your wonderful comments on my speech. I could feel the electricity in thr air. Great reviews - most votes ever recieved

I will be speaking about our great journey to the Republican nomination at 9:00 P.M. The movement toward a country that WINS again continues

I will be interviewed tonight on @seanhannity - Enjoy! 10:00 P.M.

In just out book, Secret Service Agent Gary Byrne doesn't believe that Crooked Hillary has the temperament or integrity to be the president!

A former Secret Service Agent for President Clinton excoriates Crooked Hillary describing her as ERRATIC & VIOLENT. Bad temperament for pres

I am getting bad marks from certain pundits because I have a small campaign staff. But small is good, flexible, save money and number one!

A massive blow to Obama's message - only 38,000 new jobs for month in just issued jobs report. That's REALLY bad!

Crooked Hillary is being badly criticized (for a Wall Street paid for ad) by PolitiFact for a false ad on me on women. She is a total fraud!

Crooked Hillary Clinton has not held a news conference in more than 7 months. Her record is so bad she is unable to answer tough questions!

Just like I have been able to spend far less money than others on the campaign and finish #1, so too should our country. We can be great!

People like @KatyTurNBC report on my campaign, but have zero access. They say what they want without any knowledge.True of so much of media!

Hillary Clinton is unfit to be president. She has bad judgement, poor leadership skills and a very bad and destructive track record. Change!

I am watching @CNN very little lately because they are so biased against me. Shows are predictable garbage! CNN and MSM is one big lie!

The Clinton News Network, sometimes referred to as @CNN , is getting more and more biased.They act so indignant-hear them behind closed doors

We just had the worst jobs report since 2010.

The Mayor of San Jose did a terrible job of ordering the protection of innocent people. The thugs were lucky supporters remained peaceful!

Many of the thugs that attacked the peaceful Trump supporters in San Jose were illegals. They burned the American flag and laughed at police

Muhammad Ali is dead at 74! A truly great champion and a wonderful guy. He will be missed by all!

Great evening in San Jose other than the thugs. My supporters are far tougher if they want to be, but fortunately they are not hostile.

So much interest in my visit to Scotland! I greatly look forward to attending the opening event @TrumpTurnberry - taking place on June 24th.

In Crooked Hillary's telepromter speech yesterday, she made up things that I said or believe but have no basis in fact. Not honest!

I don't watch or do @Morning_Joe anymore. Small audience, low ratings! I hear Mika has gone wild with hate. Joe is Joe. They lost their way!

Rally last night in San Jose was great. Tremendous love and enthusiasm in the hall. Big crowd. Outside, small group of thugs burned Am flag!

Terrible jobs report just reported. Only 38,000 jobs added. Bombshell!

Then, on June 25th- back to the USA to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

After @TrumpScotland , I will visit @TrumpDoonbeg in Ireland, the magnificent resort fronting on the Atlantic Ocean.

After @TrumpTurnberry I will be visiting Aberdeen, the oil capital of Europe, to see my great club, @TrumpScotland .

On June 22- I will be going to Scotland to celebrate the opening of the newly renovated @TrumpTurnberry Resort, the worlds best.

"@free_SA_BD: @realDonaldTrump A vote for Trump is a vote to restore our great country."

A 60% increase in Texas Blue Cross/Blue Shield through ObamaCare. I told you so, there is panic and anger as healthcare costs explode!

So great to have the endorsement and support of Paul Ryan. We will both be working very hard to Make America Great Again!

Bad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton! Reading poorly from the telepromter! She doesn't even look presidential!

Crooked Hillary no longer has credibility - too much failure in office. People will not allow another four years of incompetence!

Crooked Hillary Clinton, who I would love to call Lyin' Hillary, is getting ready to totally misrepresent my foreign policy positions.

After the litigation is disposed of and the case won, I have instructed my execs to open Trump U(?), so much interest in it! I will be pres.

Even though I have a very biased and unfair judge in the Trump U civil case in San Diego, I have thousands of great reviews & will win case!

With all of the Crooked Hillary Clinton's foreign policy experience, she has made so many mistakes - and I mean real monsters! No more HRC.

Wow, USA Today did todays cover story on my record in lawsuits. Verdict: 450 wins, 38 losses. Isn't that what you want for your president?

Do you ever notice that @CNN gives me very little proper representation on my policies. Just watched-nobody knew anything about my foreign P

Bernie Sanders was right when he said that Crooked Hillary Clinton was not qualified to be president because she suffers from BAD judgement!

Crooked Hillary Clinton has zero natural talent - she should not be president. Her temperament is bad and her decision making ability-zilch!

Same failing @nytimes "reporter" who wrote discredited women's story last week wrote another terrible story on me today- will never learn!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is a fraud who has put the public and country at risk by her illegal and very stupid use of e-mails. Many missing!

So I raised/gave $5,600,000 for the veterans and the media makes me look bad! They do anything to belittle - totally biased.

Congratulations to @seanhannity on his tremendous increase in television ratings. Speaking of ratings- I will be on his show tonight @10pE.

I am getting great credit for my press conference today. Crooked Hillary should be admonished for not having a press conference in 179 days.

Katie Couric, the third rate reporter, who has been largely forgotten, should be ashamed of herself for the fraudulent editing of her doc.

I will be interviewed on @seanhannity tonight at 10pmE on @FoxNews . Enjoy!

So many veterans groups are beyond happy with all of the money I raised/gave! It was my great honor - they do an amazing job.

Just finished a press conference in Trump Tower wherein I gave information on which VETERANS groups got the $5,600,000 that I raised/gave!

I have raised/given a tremendous amount of money to our great VETERANS, and have got nothing but bad publicity for doing so. Watch!

So many great things happening - new poll numbers looking good! News conference at 11:00 A.M. today, Trump Tower!

I should have easily won the Trump University case on summary judgement but have a judge, Gonzalo Curiel, who is totally biased against me.

I have a judge in the Trump University civil case, Gonzalo Curiel (San Diego), who is very unfair. An Obama pick. Totally biased-hates Trump

I hope everyone had a great Memorial Day!

I would have had millions of votes more in the primaries (than Crooked Hillary) if I only had one opponent, instead of sixteen. Broke record

Have a great Memorial Day and remember that we will soon MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

The endorsement of me by the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents was the first time that they ever endorsed a presidential candidate. Nice!

In getting the endorsement of the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents (thank you), the statement was made that the WALL was very necessary!

Obama says a WALL at our southern border won't enhance our security (wrong) and yet he now wants to build a much bigger wall (fence) at W.H.

If dummy Bill Kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an Independent, say good bye to the Supreme Court!

The Republican Party has to be smart & strong if it wants to win in November. Can't allow lightweights to set up a spoiler Indie candidate!

Bill Kristol has been wrong for 2yrs-an embarrassed loser, but if the GOP can't control their own, then they are not a party. Be tough, R's!

Good news is that my campaign has perhaps more cash than any campaign in the history of politics- b/c I stand 100% behind everything we do.

Heading to D.C. to see and hear ROLLING THUNDER. Amazing people that LOVE OUR COUNTRY. Great spirit!

Honor Memorial Day by thinking of and respecting all of the great men and women that gave their lives for us and our country! We love them.

Does President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while he's in Japan? Thousands of American lives lost. #MDW

Don't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. The only quote that matters is a quote from me!

I am always on the front page of the failing @nytimes , but when I won the GOP nomination, I'm in the back of the paper. Very dishonest!

The media is on a new phony kick about my management style. I spend much less money & get much better results! What we need as Prez!

The failing @nytimes wrote a story about my management style & that I don't have many people. I have 73, Hillary has 800- & I'm beating her.

I (we) broke the all-time record for most votes gotten in a Republican Primary - by a lot - and with many states left to go! Thank you.

The U.S. has 69 treaties with other countries where we would have to defend them and their borders. How nice, but what do we get? NOT ENOUGH

. @SanDiegoPD - Fantastic job on handling the thugs who tried to disrupt our very peaceful and well attended rally. Greatly appreciated!

Thank you @BillyJoel - many friends just told me you gave a very kind shoutout at MSG. Appreciate it- love your music!

I am on @oreillyfactor tonight, a big special. @FoxNews at 8:00 P.M. ENJOY!

Bill O'Reilly doing a major special on @OreillyFactor tonight- @FoxNews at 8pmE. Watch it, should be good! #Trump2016

Poll data shows that @marcorubio does by far the best in holding onto his Senate seat in Florida. Important to keep the MAJORITY. Run Marco!

My wife @MELANIATRUMP , and my children will be featured on @FoxNews with @Greta - 7pmE. Enjoy! #MeetTheTrumps #Trump2016

I find it offensive that Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, pretended to be Native American to get in Harvard.

Thank you Mr. & Mrs. @TomBarrackJr for the wonderful and magical evening last night. It will not be forgotten. #Trump2016

. @kimguilfoyle - just watched you on @OutnumberedFNC - thank you!

The Inspector General's report on Crooked Hillary Clinton is a disaster. Such bad judgement and temperament cannot be allowed in the W.H.

Thank you Washington! Honored to say, on behalf of our great movement, we have broken the all time record for votes in GOP primary history.

The protesters in New Mexico were thugs who were flying the Mexican flag. The rally inside was big and beautiful, but outside, criminals!

Crooked Hillary Clinton just can't close the deal with Bernie. I had to knock out 16 very good and smart candidates. Hillary doesn't have it

Goofy Senator Elizabeth Warren @elizabethforma has done less in the U.S. Senate than practically any other senator. All talk, no action!

@elizabethforma Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes known as Pocahontas, bought foreclosed housing and made a quick killing. Total hypocrite!

@elizabethforma Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas because she faked the fact she is native American, is a lowlife!

Great rally in New Mexico, amazing crowd! Now in L.A. Big rally in Anaheim.

Great honor to receive today's endorsement of @RickSantorum . Really nice! #Trump2016

After raising, w/ no obligation, almost $6M for Vets, I couldn't believe protesters formed @Trump Tower. JUST OUT- SENT BY CROOKED HILLARY!

Crooked Hillary Clinton overregulates, overtaxes and doesn't care about jobs. Most importantly, she suffers from plain old bad judgement!

I just released my financial disclosure forms, the largest numbers in the history of the F.E.C. Even the dishonest media thinks great!

Amazingly, with all of the money I have raised for the vets, I have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media.

Much of the money I have raised for our veterans has already been distributed, with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups.

While under no obligation to do so, I have raised between 5 & 6 million dollars, including 1million dollars from me, for our VETERANS. Nice!

I will be interviewed on @oreillyfactor at 8:00 P.M. Enjoy!

Obama’s VA Secretary just said we shouldn't measure wait times. Hillary says VA problems are not ‘widespread.’ I will take care of our vets!

In trade, military and EVERYTHING else, it will be AMERICA FIRST! This will quickly lead to our ultimate goal: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

The American people are sick and tired of not being able to lead normal lives and to constantly be on the lookout for terror and terrorists!

Bernie Sanders is continuing his quest because he believes that Crooked Hillary Clinton will be forced out of the race - e-mail scandal!

Crooked Hillary wants a radical 500% increase in Syrian refugees. We can’t allow this. Time to get smart and protect America!

How can Crooked Hillary say she cares about women when she is silent on radical Islam, which horribly oppresses women?

Why do the networks continue to put dopey @BillKristol on panels when he has called every single shot about me wrong for 2 yrs?

Hillary Clinton is not qualified to be president because her judgement has been proven to be so bad! Would be four more years of stupidity!

Crooked Hillary said that I want guns brought into the school classroom. Wrong!

Crooked Hillary Clintons foreign interventions unleashed ISIS in Syria, Iraq and Libya. She is reckless and dangerous!

. @CNN is so negative, getting even worse as I get closer. Just had two anti-Trump losers with zero rebuttal from my team. Turning off!

Crooked Hillary wants to get rid of all guns and yet she is surrounded by bodyguards who are fully armed. No more guns to protect Hillary!

While our wonderful president was out playing golf all day, the TSA is falling apart, just like our government! Airports a total disaster!

Crooked Hillary is spending tremendous amounts of Wall Street money on false ads against me. She is a very dishonest person!

Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to essentially abolish the 2nd Amendment. No gun owner can ever vote for Clinton!

Thank you @TheTodaysGolfer for the wonderful statement that "the new par 3 9th hole @Trump Turnberry could be the most dramatic in Britain."

@montgomeriefdn Colin, great to have you at Trump Turnberry. So proud of you and your GREAT playing! You made winning MAJORS look easy!

Thank you for your wonderful endorsement today @TGowdySC . It means a great deal to me. We will not disappoint! #Trump2016

Failing @NYTimes will always take a good story about me and make it bad. Every article is unfair and biased. Very sad!

Thanks @piersmorgan ! "Trump is the most unpredictable, extraordinary, entertaining&massively popular candidate this country has ever seen."

Crooked Hillary can't even close the deal with Bernie - and the Dems have it rigged in favor of Hillary. Four more years of this? No way!

Crooked Hillary Clinton looks presidential? I don't think so! Four more years of Obama and our country will never come back. ISIS LAUGHS!

Look where the world is today, a total mess, and ISIS is still running around wild. I can fix it fast, Hillary has no chance!

Crooked Hillary has zero imagination and even less stamina. ISIS, China, Russia and all would love for her to be president. 4 more years!

I said that Crooked Hillary Clinton is "not qualified" to be president because she has "very bad judgement" - Bernie said the same thing!

How quality a woman is Rowanne Brewer Lane to have exposed the @nytimes as a disgusting fraud? Thank you Rowanne.

Looks like yet another terrorist attack. Airplane departed from Paris. When will we get tough, smart and vigilant? Great hate and sickness!

My list of potential U.S. Supreme Court Justices was very well recieved. During the next number of weeks I may be adding to the list!

Some low-life journalist claims that I "made a pass" at her 29 years ago. Never happened! Like the @nytimes story which has become a joke!

Why did Clinton supporter @AlisonForKY declare Crooked Hillary winner in KY when AP hasn't even called the race?

Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Democrats - the system is rigged against him. Many of his disenfranchised fans are for me!

Paul Begala, the dopey @CNN flunky and head of the Pro-Hillary Clinton Super PAC, has knowingly committed fraud in his first ad against me.

Congratulations to THE MOVEMENT, we have just won THE GREAT STATE OF OREGON. The vote percentage is even higher than anticipated! Thank you.

Michael Barbaro, the author of the now discredited @nytimes hit piece on me with women, has in past tweeted badly about me. He should resign

I look so forward to debating Crooked Hillary Clinton! Democrat Primaries are rigged, e-mail investigation is rigged - so time to get it on!

I can't believe that @CNN would allow the very nice Jeffrey Lord to be savaged by a panel of seven Trump haters. 7 to 1 - Don't watch CNN!

Well, that is it. Well done Megyn --- and they all lived happily ever after! Now let us all see how "THE MOVEMENT" does in Oregon tonight!

Will go back on for a final question now!

I like Michael Douglas!

"@TrumpTrainRider: . @realDonaldTrump Watching you on Fox with @megynkelly now. Can't wait to hear what you two talked about."

I will be live tweeting @megynkelly Show in 10 minutes. Should be interesting. Will be on Fox Network! ENJOY!

Wall Street paid for ad is a fraud, just like Crooked Hillary! Their main line had nothing to do with women, and they knew it. Apologize?

Do you think Crooked Hillary will finally close the deal? If she can't win Kentucky, she should drop out of race. System rigged!

I look forward to watching @megynkelly tonight, 8 PM ET. It will be interesting to see how she treats me—I think she will be very fair.

How can Crooked Hillary put her husband in charge of the economy when he was responsible for NAFTA, the worst economic deal in U.S. history?

Crooked Hillary said her husband is going to be in charge of the economy.If so, he should run,not her.Will he bring the "energizer" to D.C.?

Crooked Hillary can't close the deal with Bernie Sanders. Will be another bad day for her!

Amazing that Crooked Hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the WORST abuser of woman in U.S. political history

Oregon is voting today. Keep the big numbers going - VOTE TRUMP! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Crooked Hillary Clinton put out an ad where I am misquoted on women. Can't believe she would misrepresent the facts! My hit was on China

The pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line. "You can tell them to go BLANK themselves" - was about China, NOT WOMEN!

Wow, 30,000 e-mails were deleted by Crooked Hillary Clinton. She said they had to do with a wedding reception. Liar! How can she run?

What Barbara Res does not say is that she would call my company endlessly, and for years, trying to come back. I said no.

I gave a woman named Barbara Res a top N.Y. construction job, when that was unheard of, and now she is nasty. So much for a nice thank you!

"In politics, and in life, ignorance is not a virtue." This is a primary reason that President Obama is the worst president in U.S. history!

The writer of the now proven false story in the @nytimes , Michael Barbaro, who was interviewed on CBS this morning, was unable to respond.

Over 50 women were interviewed by the @nytimes yet they only wrote about 6. That’s because there were so many positive statements.

No wonder the @nytimes is failing—who can believe what they write after the false, malicious & libelous story they did on me.

The failing @nytimes is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women.

With the coming forward today of the woman central to the failing @nytimes hit piece on me, we have exposed the article as a fraud!

A political commentator for @cnn , which I no longer watch, said "Trump showed some weakness in the Repub Primaries." I set all-time record!

Wow, Rowanne Brewer, the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday, was on @foxandfriends saying Times lied

The @nytimes is so dishonest. Their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by Rowanne Brewer, who said it was a lie!

That was an amazing interview on @foxandfriends - I hope the rest of the media picks it up to show how totally dishonest the @nytimes is!

Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Dems. The system is rigged against him. He should run as an independent! Run Bernie, run.

The @washingtonpost report on potential VP candidates is wrong. Marco Rubio and most others mentioned are NOT under consideration.

The media is really on a witch-hunt against me. False reporting, and plenty of it - but we will prevail!

Why did the failing @nytimes refuse to use any of the names given to them that I was so proud to have helped with their careers. DISHONEST!

Wow, I have had so many calls from high ranking people laughing at the stupidity of the failing @nytimes piece. Massive front page for that!

Why doesn't the failing @nytimes write the real story on the Clintons and women? The media is TOTALLY dishonest!

Everyone is laughing at the @nytimes for the lame hit piece they did on me and women.I gave them many names of women I helped-refused to use

The failing @nytimes wrote yet another hit piece on me. All are impressed with how nicely I have treated women, they found nothing. A joke!

Thank you for the nice words this morning @KellyRiddell . Well delivered and totally logical! @CNN @FoxNews

Wow, @CNN is really working hard to make me look as bad as possible. Very unprofessional. Hurting in ratings - bad television!

If Crooked Hillary Clinton can't close the deal on Crazy Bernie, how is she going to take on China, Russia, ISIS and all of the others?

. @thehill Your story about me & the carbon tax is absolutely incorrect—it is just the opposite. I will not support or endorse a carbon tax!

Senator Lindsey Graham called me yesterday, very much to my surprise, and we had a very interesting talk about national security, and more!

If it were up to goofy Elizabeth Warren, we’d have no jobs in America—she doesn’t have a clue.

In interview I told @AP that my taxes are under routine audit and I would release my tax returns when audit is complete, not after election!

Isn’t it funny when a failed Senator like goofy Elizabeth Warren can spend a whole day tweeting about Trump & gets nothing done in Senate?

Goofy Elizabeth Warren lied when she says I want to abolish the Federal Minimum Wage. See media—asking for increase!

Our Native American Senator, goofy Elizabeth Warren, couldn’t care less about the American worker…does nothing to help!

Goofy Elizabeth Warren is now using the woman’s card like her friend crooked Hillary. See her dumb tweet “when a woman stands up to you…”

If the people of Massachusetts found out what an ineffective Senator goofy Elizabeth Warren has been, she would lose!

Goofy Elizabeth Warren didn’t have the guts to run for POTUS. Her phony Native American heritage stops that and VP cold.

Goofy Elizabeth Warren has been one of the least effective Senators in the entire U.S. Senate. She has done nothing!

I don't want to hit Crazy Bernie Sanders too hard yet because I love watching what he is doing to Crooked Hillary. His time will come!

Big wins in West Virginia and Nebraska. Get ready for November - Crooked Hillary, who is looking very bad against Crazy Bernie, will lose!

The Clintons spend millions on negative ads on me & I can’t tell the truth about her husband? Don’t feel sorry for crooked Hillary!

It was so great being in Nebraska last week. Today is the big day--get out and vote!

I look very much forward to meeting w/Paul Ryan & the GOP Party Leadership on Thurs in DC. Together, we will beat the Dems at all levels!

It is only the people that were never asked to be VP that tell the press that they will not take the position.

It was Rosie O'Donnell who ate the cake in the vicious Hillary commercial about me, not Crooked Hillary! @marthamaccallum

Why does the media, with a strong push from Crooked Hillary, keep pushing the false narrative that I want to raise taxes. Exactly opposite!

. #RepMikeKelly Great job on @foxandfriends this morning. Thank you for the nice words!

Get out and vote Nebraska, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Get out and vote West Virginia, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I am lowering taxes far more than any other candidate. Any negotiated increase by Congress to my proposal would still be lower than current!

I will have set the all time record in primary votes in the Republican party --despite having to compete against 17 other people!

If I only had 1 person running against me in the primaries like Hillary Clinton, I would have gotten 10 million more votes than she did!

Crooked Hillary Clinton says that she got more primary votes than Donald Trump. But I had 17 people to beat—she had one!

" @daybastrop @foxandfriends @BretBaier The liars that signed the pledge and now won't support @realDonaldTrump IS the reason they are losers

Will be interviewed by @MariaBartiromo on @FoxBizAlert at 7:30 A.M. Enjoy!

Wow, I hear @Morning_Joe has gone really hostile ever since I said I won't do or watch the show anymore.They misrepresent my positions!

I will be interviewed on @CNN at 7:00 A.M.

. @drmoore Russell Moore is truly a terrible representative of Evangelicals and all of the good they stand for. A nasty guy with no heart!

I will be interviewed on @NewDay @CNN at 7:00 A.M.

I will win the election against Crooked Hillary despite the people in the Republican Party that are currently and selfishly opposed to me!

On @seanhannity show @FoxNews now. ENJOY!

Crooked Hillary just can't close the deal with Bernie. It will be the same way with ISIS, and China on trade, and Mexico at the border. Bad!

. @KellyannePolls Kellyanne, you were fantastic on @meetthepress today. Keep going - I will win for the people. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I will be interviewed on @meetthepress this morning. Enjoy!

I will be interviewed on This Week with George S this morning. Enjoy!

. @EdGoeas thank you for your support tonight on @JudgeJeanine .

Remember when the two failed presidential candidates, Lindsey Graham and Jeb Bush, signed a binding PLEDGE? They broke the deal, no honor!

I am honored that the great men and women of the @Teamsters have created a movement from within called Teamsters for Trump! Thank you.

I am going to keep our jobs in the U.S., and totally rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. Crooked Hillary has no clue! @Teamsters

Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective. Does nothing. All talk, no action -- maybe her Native American name?

Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy! I'm driving her nuts.

Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders. Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me.

Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska. Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant, but leaves behind amazing legacy.

Goofy Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton’s flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American.

Let’s properly check goofy Elizabeth Warren’s records to see if she is Native American. I say she’s a fraud!

I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. I will defeat them both.

I hear @JoeNBC of rapidly fading @Morning_Joe is pushing hard for a third party candidate to run. This will guarantee a Crooked Hillary win.

Joe Scarborough initially endorsed Jeb Bush and Jeb crashed, then John Kasich and that didn't work. Not much power or insight!

Thank you to teachers across America! When I become POTUS we will make education a far more important component of our life than it is now.

Crooked Hillary has ZERO leadership ability. As Bernie Sanders says, she has bad judgement. Constantly playing the women's card - it is sad!

Paul Ryan said that I inherited something very special, the Republican Party. Wrong, I didn't inherit it, I won it with millions of voters!

So many great endorsements yesterday, except for Paul Ryan! We must put America first and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Governor Rick Perry said "Donald Trump is one of the most talented people running for the Presidency I've ever seen." Thank you Rick!

Unlike crooked Hillary Clinton, who wants to destroy all miners, I want wages to go up in America. We will do so by bringing back jobs!

Thank you West Virginia. Let's keep it going. Go out and vote on Tuesday - we will win big. #Trump2016

Can you believe Crooked Hillary said, "We are going to put a whole lot of coal miners&coal companies out of business." She then apologized.

Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democrats—both with delegates & otherwise. He should show them, & run as an Independent.

I will be interviewed by @BretBaier @SpecialReport at 6pm ET tonight @FoxNews

Many reports that I will be attending the Alvarez/Khan fight this weekend in Vegas. Totally untrue! Unfortunately I have other plans.

I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:30 A.M. Enjoy!

I will be interviewed on @TODAYshow and Good Morning America at 7:00 A.M.

I will be interviewed on @Morning_Joe at 6:15 A.M. Enjoy!

I would rather run against Crooked Hillary Clinton than Bernie Sanders and that will happen because the books are cooked against Bernie!

What a great evening we had. So interesting that Sanders beat Crooked Hillary. The dysfunctional system is totally rigged against him!

. @oreillyfactor Please correct, I WON Virginia!

Thank you Indiana, we were just projected to be the winner. We have won in every category. You are very special people-I will never forget!

Lyin' Ted Cruz consistently said that he will, and must, win Indiana. If he doesn't he should drop out of the race-stop wasting time & money

Wow, Lyin' Ted Cruz really went wacko today. Made all sorts of crazy charges. Can't function under pressure - not very presidential. Sad!

Will be in South Bend, Indiana in a short while -- big rally! See you soon!

Will be interviewed on @seanhannity tonight at 10pmE. Enjoy! #INPrimary

I will be campaigning in Indiana all day. Things are looking great, and the support of Bobby Knight has been so amazing. Today will be fun!

Everybody is talking about the protesters burning the American flags and proudly waving Mexican flags. I want America First - so do voters!

Gov Mike Pence has just stated that Donald Trump has taken a strong stance on Hoosier jobs, and he thanks me! I will bring back jobs to USA.

Crooked Hillary Clinton said she is used to "dealing with men who get off the reservation." Actually, she has done poorly with such men!

I will be interviewed on @CNN @NewDay at 7:30 A.M. Enjoy!

. @KarlRove is a failed Jeb Bushy. Never says anything good & never will, even after I beat Hillary. Shouldn't be on the air!

Will be in Terre Haute, Indiana in a short while -- big rally! See you soon!

I watched Sen. Graham @FaceTheNation . Why don't they say that I ran him out of the race like a little boy, and in the end he had no support?

I will be in Indiana on Sunday and Monday at four MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN rallies. See you there!

Thank you @MikeOzanian for the nice comments on @FoxNews today. Great job!

The economy is bad and getting worse-almost ZERO growth this quarter. Nobody can beat me on the economy (and jobs). MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN

The "protesters" in California were thugs and criminals. Many are professionals. They should be dealt with strongly by law enforcement!

. @AC360 Anderson, so amazing. Your mother is, and always has been, an incredible woman!

We are now at 1001 delegates. We will win on the first ballot and are not wasting time and effort on other ballots because system is rigged!

Crooked Hillary Clinton, perhaps the most dishonest person to have ever run for the presidency, is also one of the all time great enablers!

Wow, the ridiculous deal made between Lyin'Ted Cruz and 1 for 42 John Kasich has just blown up. What a dumb deal - dead on arrival!

So many false and phony T.V. commercials being broadcast in Indiana. Reminds me of Florida where thousands were put up-I won in a landslide!

I will be in Evansville, Indiana, with the great Bobby Knight (who last night endorsed me) at 12:00 this afternoon. See you there!

Lyin' Ted Cruz, who can never beat Hillary Clinton and has NO path to victory, has chosen a V.P.candidate who failed badly in her own effort

I will be interviewed on the @TODAYshow at 7:00 A.M. this morning. Enjoy!

Thank you to all for the wonderful reviews of my foreign policy speech. I will soon be speaking in great detail on numerous other topics!

Getting the strong endorsement of the great coach, Bobby Knight, has been a highlight of my stay in Indiana. Big speech tomorrow with Bobby!

I am in Indiana where we just had a great rally. Fantastic people! Staying at a Holiday Inn Express - new and clean, not bad!

How bad is the New York Times—the most inaccurate coverage constantly. Always trying to belittle. Paper has lost its way!

Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democrats—both with delegates & otherwise. He should show them, and run as an Independent!

The Cruz-Kasich pact is under great strain. This joke of a deal is falling apart, not being honored and almost dead. Very dumb!

On the way to the great state of Rhode Island- big rally. Then to Pennsylvania for rest of day and night!

Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - can't make a deal work.

Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.

Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness!

Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors & special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad!

Wow, just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION!

I am happy to hear how badly the @nytimes is doing. It is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down. Becoming irrelevant!

I will be in Maryland this afternoon for a major rally. Things are looking good for Tuesday!

. @AndreBauer Great job and advice on @CNN @jaketapper Thank you!

. @Borisep was great on @JudgeJeanine tonight. Very smart commentary that will prove to be correct!

As soon as John Kasich is hit with negative ads, he will drop like a rock in the polls against Crooked Hillary Clinton. I will win!

I had a great day campaigning in Connecticut. Looking for a big vote on Tuesday!

Congratulations to @seanhannity on his great ratings and ratings increase as reported by the @AP today. Amazing job!

Will be spending the day campaigning in Connecticut, another state where jobs are being stolen by other countries. I will stop this fast!

I met Prince on numerous occasions. He was an amazing talent and wonderful guy. He will be greatly missed!

Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237. Now he can't get to 1237. Drop out LYIN' Ted.

Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify!

Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out!

I will be doing the @TODAYshow with my wife, Melania, and the rest of my family in a major Town Hall. Hopefully, it will be fun! Enjoy.7A.M.

We are going to bring steel and manufacturing back to Indiana!

Ted Cruz is mathematically out of winning the race. Now all he can do is be a spoiler, never a nice thing to do. I will beat Hillary!

Thank you New York, I will never forget!

. @CNN is so negative it is impossible to watch. Terrible panel, angry haters. Bill O @oreillyfactor said such an amazing thing about me!

"@kdk144: @realDonaldTrump Everybody is "In A New York State of Mind" now!"

A big day for New York and for our COUNTRY! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I am on @foxandfriends at 7:00 A.M. ENJOY!

Lyin’ Ted Cruz even voted against Superstorm Sandy aid and September 11th help. So many New Yorkers devastated. Cruz hates New York!

Kasich only looks O.K. in polls against Hillary because nobody views him as a threat and therefore have placed ZERO negative ads against him

Lyin' Ted Cruz can't win with the voters so he has to sell himself to the bosses-I am millions of VOTES ahead! Hillary would destroy him & K

I would have millions of votes more than Hillary except for the fact that I had 17 opponents and she just had a socialist named Bernie!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is spending a fortune on ads against me. I am the one person she doesn't want to run against. Will be such fun!

Lyin' Ted Cruz can't get votes (I am millions ahead of him) so he has to get his delegates from the Republican bosses. It won't work!

Lyin' Ted Cruz will never be able to beat Hillary. Despite a rigged delegate system, I am hundreds of delegates ahead of him.

I'll be in one of my favorite places this morning, Staten Island. Big crowd, will be fun!

I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 9:00 A.M. I will be talking about the rigged and boss controlled Republican primaries!

Big protest march in Colorado on Friday afternoon! Don't let the bosses take your vote!

The rules DID CHANGE in Colorado shortly after I entered the race in June because the pols and their bosses knew I would win with the voters

Biggest story in politics is now happening in the great State of Colorado where over one million people have been precluded from voting!

Great to be on @andersoncooper tonight with my wonderful family. Will be rebroadcast at 12:00 A.M. (EASTERN).

Leaving for Albany, New York now, massive crowd expected. Very exciting!

Why does the liberal media think Bill O'Reilly ( @oreillyfactor ) is a complete and total vulgarian? I don't think so!

I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:00 A.M. Enjoy!

The people of Colorado had their vote taken away from them by the phony politicians. Biggest story in politics. This will not be allowed!

How is it possible that the people of the great State of Colorado never got to vote in the Republican Primary? Great anger - totally unfair!

I win a state in votes and then get non-representative delegates because they are offered all sorts of goodies by Cruz campaign. Bad system!

The @nytimes purposely covers me so inaccurately. I want other nations to pay the U.S. for our defense of them. We are the suckers-no more!

"@jlopez05391: @realDonaldTrump Rochester loves you! See you tomorrow! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 #TrumpTrain " A big crowd!

Bernie Sanders says that Hillary Clinton is unqualified to be president. Based on her decision making ability, I can go along with that!

Isn't it a shame that the person who will have by far the most delegates and many millions more votes than anyone else, me, still must fight

“Donald Trump—The Disrupter” will air on @FoxNews Saturday night and Sunday night at 8 PM ET. Anchored by @BretBaier . @johnrobertsFox

"@R_U_OK_UK: @realDonaldTrump @glozee1 @PaulManafort @CNN @DanScavino Vote trump to save the west. Don't become like Europe - #WakeUpAmerica

So great to be in New York. Catching up on many things (remember, I am still running a major business while I campaign) and loving it!

Unbelievable evening. Just made a speech in front 17,000 amazing New Yorkers in Bethpage, Long Island--- great to be home!

I was not scheduled to be on the @oreillyfactor . Pure fiction!

It is so great to be back home! Looking forward to a great rally tonight in Bethpage, Long Island!

Wisconsin, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Will be interviewed on @SeanHannity on @FoxNews from #Wisconsin tonight. My wife, Melania, will join me for the entire show.

A great day in Wisconsin, many stops, many great people! Melania is joining me on Monday. Big crowds. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I am on @FoxNews with @greta doing a town hall, from Wisconsin- now! Enjoy! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016

Congratulations to @gohermie for winning the @ShellHouOpen . We are all proud of you @TNGCBedminster & all @TrumpGolf clubs! Great going!

I will be on @FoxNewsSunday with Chris Wallace this morning. Enjoy!

I will be interviewed by @jdickerson on @FaceTheNation tomorrow morning. Enjoy! #Trump2016

. @FoxNews should be ashamed for allowing experts to explain how to make a nuclear attack!

. @HeyTammyBruce - Thank you for your nice words on Fox today. They never use my full statements on nuclear, which you would agree with!

Great honor to have @GOP General Counsel, #JohnRyder as a Trump delegate in TN. RNC meeting well worth it! Unifying the party!

Wisconsin has suffered a great loss of jobs and trade, but if I win, all of the bad things happening in the U.S. will be rapidly reversed!

I will be in Wisconsin until the election. Jobs, trade and immigration will be big factors. I will bring jobs back home - make great deals!

If @megynkelly stopped covering me on her show, her ratings would drop like a rock! My h to h interview with @AC360 beat her by millions!

Is it possible for @megynkelly to cover anyone but Donald Trump on her terrible show. She totally misrepresents my words and positions! BAD.

Can you believe that Ted Cruz, who has been killing our country on trade for so long, just put out a Wisconsin ad talking about trade?

For the 1st time in American history, America’s 16,500 border patrol agents have issue a presidential primary endorsement—me! Thank you.

The National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) said that our open border is the biggest physical & economic threat facing the American people!

The Club For Growth said in their ad that 465 delegates (Cruz) plus 143 delegates (Kasich) is more than my 739 delegates. Try again!

The Club For Growth,which asked me for $1,000,000 in an extortion attempt, just put up a Wisconsin ad with incorrect math.What a dumb group!

Just had a very nice meeting with @Reince Priebus and the @GOP . Looking forward to bringing the Party together --- and it will happen!

"@Gearssuxs: @loudobbsnews @realDonaldTrump I'm a democrat and switch over to republican just to vote for trump in the primary." Great!

. @DavidGregory got thrown off of TV by NBC, fired like a dog! Now he is on @CNN being nasty to me. Not nice!

Final #'s just announced in the GREAT State of MO. TRUMP WINS! New certified #'s show a 365 vote increase for me- @least 12 more delegates!

Why aren't people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened, that is before she found out the episode was on tape?

Wow, Corey Lewandowski, my campaign manager and a very decent man, was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at tapes-nothing there!

How come the @TODAYshow & @chucktodd show the new @NBCNews Poll for Hillary vs Bernie but do not show the SAME poll where I am killing Cruz?

I have millions more votes/hundreds more dels than Cruz or Kasich, and yet am not being treated properly by the Republican Party or the RNC.

Wow, @CNN has nothing but my opponents on their shows. Really one-sided and unfair reporting. Maybe I shouldn't do their town-hall tonight!

We need to secure our borders ASAP. No games, we must be smart, tough and vigilant. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN & MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN!

Lyin' Ted, I have already beaten you in all debates, and am way ahead of you in votes and delegates. You should focus on jobs & illegal imm!

Lyin'Ted Cruz is weak & losing big, so now he wants to debate again. But, according to Drudge,Time and on-line polls, I have won all debates

After the way I beat Gov. Scott Walker (and Jeb, Rand, Marco and all others) in the Presidential Primaries, no way he would ever endorse me!

Just released that international gangs are all over our cities. This will end when I am President!

Ted Cruz is incensed that I want to refocus NATO on terrorism, as well as current mission, but also want others to PAY FAIR SHARE, a must!

A detainee released from Gitmo has killed an American. When will our so-called "leaders" ever learn!

I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:30. Things are looking good, had a great Easter-look forward to spending the week in Wisconsin!

The United States cannot continue to make such bad, one-sided trade deals. There are only so many jobs we can give up. No more!

Just to show you how unfair Republican primary politics can be, I won the State of Louisiana and get less delegates than Cruz-Lawsuit coming

Why can't the pundits be honest? Hopefully we are all looking for a strong and great country again. I will make it strong and great! JOBS!

Another radical Islamic attack, this time in Pakistan, targeting Christian women & children. At least 67 dead,400 injured. I alone can solve

Happy Easter to all, have a great day!

My statement on NATO being obsolete and disproportionately too expensive (and unfair) for the U.S. are now, finally, receiving plaudits!

Wow, sleepy eyes @chucktodd is at it again. He is do totally biased. The things I am saying are correct. - far better vision than the others

I am interviewed on This Week on @ABC this morning. Enjoy!

Remember, I am the only candidate who is self-funding. While I am given little credit for this by the voters, I am not bought like others!

Don't believe the @FoxNews Polls, they are just another phony hit job on me. I will beat Hillary Clinton easily in the General Election.

Wisconsin's economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in U.S., jobs are leaving. I will make our economy strong again - bring in jobs

Nobody will protect our Nation like Donald J. Trump. Our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong. Illegals out!

Lyin' Ted Cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with The National Enq.were caused by me. I had NOTHING to do with story!

The press is going out of their way to convince people that I do not like or respect women, when they know that it is just the opposite!

The media is so after me on women Wow, this is a tough business. Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump!

Top suspect in Paris massacre, Salah Abdeslam, who also knew of the Brussels attack, is no longer talking. Weak leaders, ridiculous laws!

Wow, just released that $67 million in negative ads was spent on me. How am I still number one - by a lot?

I didn't start the fight with Lyin'Ted Cruz over the GQ cover pic of Melania, he did. He knew the PAC was putting it out - hence, Lyin' Ted!

Just won a big federal lawsuit similar in certain ways to the Trump U case but the press refuses to write about it. If I lost-monster story!

Europe and the U.S. must immediately stop taking in people from Syria. This will be the destruction of civilization as we know it! So sad!

Just announced that as many as 5000 ISIS fighters have infiltrated Europe. Also, many in U.S. I TOLD YOU SO! I alone can fix this problem!

Explain how the women on The View, which is a total disaster since the great Barbara Walters left, ever got their jobs. @abc is wasting time

. @TheView T.V. show, which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air, is constantly asking me to go on. I TELL THEM "NO"

Hillary Clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years. TIME FOR A CHANGE, I WILL SOLVE - AND FAST!

It is amazing how often I am right, only to be criticized by the media. Illegal immigration, take the oil, build the wall, Muslims, NATO!

Remember when I recently said that Brussels is a "hell hole" and a mess and the failing @nytimes wrote a critical article. I was so right!

These politicians like Cruz and Graham, who have watched ISIS and many other problems develop for years, do nothing to make things better!

. @LindseyGrahamSC and Lyin' Ted Cruz are two politicians who are very much alike - ALL TALK AND NO ACTION! Both talk about ISIS, do nothing!

It is amazing how @LindseyGrahamSC gets on so many T.V. shows talking negatively about me when I beat him so badly (ZERO) in his pres run!

We pay a disproportionate share of the cost of N.A.T.O. Why? It is time to renegotiate, and the time is now!

N.A.T.O. is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on!

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I want to thank @RealSheriffJoe for all of his help in our historic Arizona win. Could not have done it without you Joe!

While I believe I will clinch before Cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates, it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race!

I think having Jeb's endorsement hurts Lyin' Ted. Jeb spent more than $150,000,000 and got nothing. I spent a fraction of that and am first!

I will be the best by far in fighting terror. I’m the only one that was right from the beginning, & now Lyin’ Ted & others are copying me.

Just watched Hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror. She’s been in office fighting terror for 20 years- and look where we are!

Low energy Jeb Bush just endorsed a man he truly hates, Lyin’ Ted Cruz. Honestly, I can’t blame Jeb in that I drove him into oblivion!

Lyin’ Ted Cruz steals foreign policy from me, and lines from Michael Douglas— just another dishonest politician.

Lyin' Ted Cruz denied that he had anything to do with the G.Q. model photo post of Melania. That's why we call him Lyin' Ted!

Hopefully the Republican Party can come together and have a big WIN in November, paving the way for many great Supreme Court Justices!

Much bigger win than anticipated in Arizona. Thank you, I will never forget!

Incompetent Hillary, despite the horrible attack in Brussels today, wants borders to be weak and open-and let the Muslims flow in. No way!

Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful, Lyin' Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife!

Pres. Obama should leave the baseball game in Cuba immediately & get home to Washington- where a #POTUS , under a serious emergency belongs!

Obama, and all others, have been so weak, and so politically correct, that terror groups are forming and getting stronger! Shame.

My heart & prayers go out to all of the victims of the terrible #Brussels tragedy. This madness must be stopped, and I will stop it.

I have proven to be far more correct about terrorism than anybody- and it’s not even close. Hopefully AZ and UT will be voting for me today!

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

President Obama looks and sounds so ridiculous making his speech in Cuba, especially in the shadows of Brussels. He is being treated badly!

Do you all remember how beautiful and safe a place Brussels was. Not anymore, it is from a different world! U.S. must be vigilant and smart!

Wow, President Obama just landed in Cuba, a big deal, and Raul Castro wasn't even there to greet him. He greeted Pope and others. No respect

Big Republican Dinner tonight at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach. I will be there!

So the highly overrated anchor, @megynkelly , is allowed to constantly say bad things about me on her show, but I can't fight back? Wrong!

The protesters blocked a major highway yesterday, delaying entry to my RALLY in Arizona by hours, and the media blames my supporters!

Why is it that the horrendous protesters, who scream, curse punch, shut down roads/doors during my RALLIES, are never blamed by media? SAD!

Will be interviewed on @ThisWeekABC this morning. Enjoy!

The rallies in Utah and Arizona were great! Tremendous crowds and spirit. Just returned but will be going back soon.

. @AndreaTantaros - You are a true journalistic professional. I so agree with what you say. Keep up the great work! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

. @jessebwatters - Watching your show from Arizona where we just had a big rally. It is fantastic- everybody loves it! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

. @DiamondandSilk - Just watched you on #WattersWorld with a large group of people. Everybody loves you- two amazing people! #Trump2016

Wow, @CNN ratings are up 75% because it's "all Trump, all the time." The networks are making a fortune off of me! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

If crazy @megynkelly didn't cover me so much on her terrible show, her ratings would totally tank. She is so average in so many ways!

Crazy @megynkelly says I don't (won't) go on her show and she still gets good ratings. But almost all of her shows are negative hits on me!

Landing in Phoenix now. Tomorrow's events will be amazing! #Trump2016

Reading @nytdavidbrooks of the NY Times is a total waste of time, he is a clown with no awareness of the world around him- dummy!

While I have never met @nytdavidbrooks of the NY Times, I consider him one of the dumbest of all pundits- he has no sense of the real world!

Heading to Phoneix. Will be arriving soon. Tomorrow a big day. Tremendous crowds expected! #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Watching @loudobbsnews - fantastic show! Has very interesting take on Paul Ryan.

Just leaving Salt Lake City, Utah- fantastic crowd with no interruptions. Love Utah- will be back!

Why haven't they released the final Missouri victory for us yet? Could it be because Cruz's guy runs Missouri?

Do you believe that Hillary Clinton now wants Obamacare for illegal immigrants? She should spend more time taking care of our great Vets!

Everybody should boycott the @megynkelly show. Never worth watching. Always a hit on Trump! She is sick, & the most overrated person on tv.

Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue. No wonder he lost!

Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney was campaigning with John Kasich & Marco Rubio, and now he is endorsing Ted Cruz. 1/2

Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney, the man who "choked" and let us all down, is now endorsing Lyin' Ted Cruz. This is good for me!

Going to Salt Lake City, Utah, for a big rally. Lyin' Ted Cruz should not be allowed to win there - Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary

Club For Growth tried to extort $1,000,000 from me. When I said NO, they went hostile with negative ads. Disgraceful!

With millions of dollars of negative and phony ads against me by the establishment, my numbers continue to go up. Can anyone explain this?

. @EWErickson got fired like a dog from RedState and now he is the one leading opposition against me.

Senator @LindseyGrahamSC made horrible statements about @SenTedCruz – and then he endorsed him. No wonder nobody trusts politicians!

Lyin' Ted Cruz lost all five races on Tuesday-and he was just given the jinx - a Lindsey Graham endorsement. Also backed Jeb. Lindsey got 0!

Hillary Clinton has been involved in corruption for most of her professional life!

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Highly overrated & crazy @megynkelly is always complaining about Trump and yet she devotes her shows to me. Focus on others Megyn!

Looking like my 5 victories on Tuesday will be just as good as if I won Ohio. Two more days and Ohio was mine!

Please explain to the dummies at the @WSJ Editorial Board that I love to debate and have won, according to Drudge etc., all 11 of them!

. @WSJ is bad at math. The good news is, nobody cares what they say in their editorials anymore, especially me!

. @WSJ Editorial says "Clinton primary vote total is 8,646,551.Trump's is 7,533,692"-a knock. But she had only 3 opponents-I had 16.Apologize

The reason lyin' Ted Cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just don't tolerate liars-a big problem!

Crazy @megynkelly is now complaining that @oreillyfactor did not defend her against me - yet her bad show is a total hit piece on me.Tough!

Great news that @FoxNews has cancelled the additional debate. How many times can the same people ask the same question? I beat Cruz debating

Crazy @megynkelly supposedly had lyin' Ted Cruz on her show last night. Ted is desperate and his lying is getting worse. Ted can't win!

Stuart Stevens, the failed campaign manager of Mitt Romney's historic loss, is now telling the Republican Party what to do with Trump. Sad!

I will be interviewed on The O'Reilly Factor this evening at 8 pm on the Fox News Channel. @oreillyfactor

Wow, just won Missouri!

I am making a big speech the night of the @FoxNews debate, but I wish everyone well. Yesterday was a big day for me with 5 wins!

Thank you to the Governor of Florida, Rick Scott, for your endorsement. I greatly appreciate your support!

In the last 2 weeks, I had $35M of negative ads against me in Florida & I won in a massive landslide.The establishment should save their $$!

Yesterday was amazing—5 victories. Lyin’ Ted Cruz had zero. Things are going very well!

. @RepTomMarino Great job on television this morning. Glad to have you on my side!

. @pastormarkburns You were great last night and we all very much appreciate it! Thank you!

I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:30 A.M. ENJOY!

Will be interviewed on @Morning_Joe at 7:40. ENJOY!

Will be interviewed on @NewDay on @CNN at 7:15 A.M.

Will be interviewed on @GMA at 7:00 A.M. Big wins last night!

I only wish my wonderful daughter Tiffany could have been with us at Mar-a-Lago for our great election victory. She is a winner! – bei The Mar-a-lago Club

Watching other networks and local news. Really good night! Crazy @megynkelly is unwatchable.

Can't watch Crazy Megyn anymore. Talks about me at 43% but never mentions that there are four people in race. With two people, big & over!

"@DumpFoxNews: @FoxNews @megynkelly If media wasn't so biased against Trump, he would've won all of the delegates.

Word is that, despite a record amount spent on negative and phony ads, I had a massive victory in Florida. Numbers out soon!

A lot of complaints from people saying my name is not on the ballot in various places in Florida? Hope this is false.

I will bring our jobs back to the U.S., and keep our companies from leaving. Nobody else can do it. Our economy will "sing" again.

In presidential voting so far, John Kasich is ZERO for 22. So why would he be a good candidate? Hillary would beat him, I will beat Hillary!

Ohio is losing jobs to Mexico, now losing Ford (and many others). Kasich is weak on illegal immigration. We need strong borders now!

Watching John Kasich being interviewed - acting so innocent and like such a nice guy. Remember him in second debate, until I put him down.

North Carolina lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs and Ohio lost 400,000 since 2000. Going to Mexico etc. NO MORE IF I WIN, WE WILL BRING BACK!

Just in, big news- I have been declared the winner of the CNMI Rep Caucus with 72.8% of the vote! Thank you! #SuperTuesday #VoteTrump

Don't reward Mitt Romney, who let us all down in the last presidential race, by voting for Kasich (who voted for NAFTA, open borders etc.).

Please remember, I am the ONLY candidate who is self-funding his campaign. Kasich, Rubio and Cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists!

I will bring our jobs back to America, fix our military and take care of our vets, end Common Core and ObamaCare, protect 2nd A, build WALL

Rubio is weak on illegal immigration, with the worst voting record in the U.S. Senate in many years. He will never MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Kasich voted for NAFTA, a disaster for Ohio, and now wants the even worse TPP approved. Vote Trump and end this madness!

"@realwwshelton: @loudobbsnews I believe that @realDonaldTrump will be the big winner tomorrow." Thank you!

Kasich has helped decimate the coal and steel industries in Ohio. I will bring them back! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Gov Kasich voted for NAFTA, which devastated Ohio and is now pushing TPP hard- bad for American workers!

Leaving the great people of North Carolina. Amazing event. Heading to Tampa now! #VoteTrump

Look forward to being in Tampa this afternoon. Wonderful crowds. Thank you, Florida!

The failing @nytimes is truly one of the worst newspapers. They knowingly write lies and never even call to fact check. Really bad people!

Because Gov. Kasich cannot run in the state of Pennsylvania-he cannot win the nomination- & should not be allowed to compete in Ohio on Tue.

Gov.Kasich of Ohio just stated on a morning show that he doesn't watch politics or anything on television, he only watches the @GolfChannel

Ohio Gov.Kasich voted for NAFTA, from which Ohio has never recovered. Now he wants TPP, which will be even worse. Ohio steel and coal dying!

Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events. Be careful Bernie, or my supporters will go to yours!

Wow, Kasich didn't qualify to run in the state of Pennsylvania, not enough signatures. Big problem!

Do the people of Ohio know that John Kasich is STRONGLY in favor of Common Core! In other words, education of your children from D.C. No way

It is Clinton and Sanders people who disrupted my rally in Chicago - and then they say I must talk to my people. Phony politicians!

The last person that Hillary or Bernie want to run against is Donald Trump --- and that is fact!

We are asking law enforcement to check for dishonest early voting in Florida- on behalf of little Marco Rubio. No way to run a country!

Word is-early voting in FL is very dishonest. Little Marco, his State Chairman, & their minions are working overtime-trying to rig the vote.

The rally in Cincinnati is ON. Media put out false reports that it was cancelled! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

On my way to Dayton, Ohio. Will be there soon!

The rally in Cincinnati is ON. Media put out false reports that it was cancelled. Will be great - love you Ohio!

Ohio had the biggest budget increase in the U.S. If it were not for striking oil, they would be bust! Governor Kasich in favor of TPP fraud!

Absentee Governor Kasich voted for NAFTA and NAFTA devastated Ohio - a disaster from which it never recovered. Kasich is good for Mexico!

The organized group of people, many of them thugs, who shut down our First Amendment rights in Chicago, have totally energized America!

I just got off the phone with the great people of Guam! Thank you for your support! #VoteTrump today! #Trump2016

Rumor has it that @politico is going out of business. Losing too much money. Great news! Likewise, dopey Mort Zuckerman's @NYDailyNews

Dr. Ben Carson- I concur. "I believe in God who can change people- he can make any of us better." @RealBenCarson

Wow, you are all correct about @FoxNews - totally biased and disgusting reporting.

Phony Club For Growth tried to shake me down for one million dollars, & is now putting out nasty negative ads on me. They are total losers!

Thank you Hawaii! #Trump2016

This was a great evening- I would like to thank everyone for their wonderful support.

Thank you Michigan! #Trump2016

Thank you Mississippi! #Trump2016

Word is I am doing very well in Michigan and Mississippi! Wow, and with all that money spent against me! Will be going to Trump Jupiter now!

I hear @NBCNews / @WSJ came out with another one of their phony polls. While I am leading, they are totally discredited after last S.C. poll

The negative television commercials about me, paid for by the politicians bosses, are a total #Mediafraud . When you watch, remember!

Mitt Romney had his chance and blew it. Lindsey Graham ran for president, got ZERO, and quit! Why are they now spokesmen against me? Sad!

Remember, I am the only one who is self-funding my campaign. All of the other candidates are bought and paid for by special interests!

Sun Sentinel says: Rubio lacks the experience, work ethic and gravitas needed to be president. HE HAS NOT EARNED YOUR VOTE!

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I employ many people in Hawaii at my great hotel in Honolulu. I’ll be there very soon. Vote for me, Hawaii!

Cruz came to Mississippi, there was nobody there, he left the state. I had a rally in Madison, MS with 10,000! Thank you!

I will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight at 10pm EST on @FoxNews ! Enjoy!

It was great being in Michigan. Remember, I am the only presidential candidate who will bring jobs back to the U.S.and protect car industry!

Don't believe the millions of dollars of phony television ads by lightweight Rubio and the R establishment. Dishonest people!

Leaving for North Carolina. Big crowd, will be fun!

Congratulation to Adam Scott and all of the folks at Trump National Doral on producing a really great WGC Tournament. Amazing finish!

I will be using Facebook and Twitter to expose dishonest lightweight Senator Marco Rubio. A record no-show in Senate, he is scamming Florida

We cannot let the failing REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT, who could not stop Obama (twice), ruin the MOVEMENT with millions of $'s in false ads!

Lindsey Graham is all over T.V., much like failed 47% candidate Mitt Romney. These nasty, angry, jealous failures have ZERO credibility!

Failed presidential candidate Lindsey Graham should respect me. I destroyed his run, brought him from 7% to 0% when he got out. Now nasty!

How do you fight millions of dollars of fraudulent commercials pushing for crooked politicians? I will be using Facebook & Twitter. Watch!

All of the phony T.V. commercials against me are bought and payed for by SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS, the bandits that tell your pols what to do

. @meetthepress and @chucktodd did a 1 hour hit job on me today – totally biased and mostly false. Dishonest media!

I am at Trump National Doral-best resort in U.S. Rory and Adam Scott are doing great! Watch on NBC at 3:00 P.M. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Thank you to @jdickerson and @FaceTheNation for a very fair and professional interview this morning. No wonder you are #1 in the ratings!

The primary plaintiff in the phony Trump University suit wants to abandon the case. Disgraceful!

Nancy Reagan, the wife of a truly great President, was an amazing woman. She will be missed!

David Brooks, of the New York Times, is closing in on being the dumbest of them all. He doesn’t have a clue.

I will be interviewed on @FaceTheNation this morning. Enjoy! @jdickerson

. @FoxNews is devastated that lightweight Senator Marco Rubio got trounced tonight and is the big loser. I won the two big states, great!

Thank you Kentucky! #Trump2016 #SuperSaturday

Thank you Louisiana! #Trump2016 #SuperSaturday

I will be at the Cadillac World Golf Championship @TrumpDoral in Miami tomorrow! Rory, Phil, Bubba, Adam, and Dustin all at the top!

I would love to be at the Cadillac World Golf Championship @TrumpDoral in Miami- but even more so in Orlando with the #TrumpTrain !

I am watching two clown announcers on @FoxNews as they try to build up failed presidential candidate #LittleMarco . Fox News is in the bag!

Romney's failed advisors, like campaign mgr Stuart Stevens are all over TV telling people how to win. But they lost- don't know how to win!

. @MittRomney was a disaster candidate who had no guts and choked! Romney is a total joke, and everyone knows it!

Thank you, Kansas! The line going into the Orlando event is over a mile long. Massive crowd expected. Leaving Kansas now, be there soon!

Getting ready to make my speech at #KansasCaucus . A great honor! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016

Thank you Kansas! Thousands of people inside- and thousands outside who couldn't get into the hall. Really amazing! #CaucusForTrump

To the people of Kentucky, Rand Paul didn't want you. Now he runs back due to his presidential failure. #VoteTrump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Why would anyone in Kentucky listen to failed presidential candidate Rand Paul re: caucus. Made a fool of himself (1%.) KY his 2nd choice!

Will be in Orlando, Florida, this afternoon. 25,000 people expected. This is a movement like our GREAT COUNTRY has never seen before!

Wow, big lines in Kansas.

For all of today's voters please remember that I am the only candidate that is self funding my campaign, I am not bought and paid for!

Great time last night in Louisiana. Big and energetic crowd. Go out and vote now, polls open. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I am in Kansas. Will be an exciting day. Big speech this morning in Wichita, and then go to caucus. Sorry CPAC (the format was fine!).

Rubio puts out ad that my pilot was a drug dealer- not true, not my pilot! Guy owned helicopter company- don't think I ever even used.

On my way to see the great people of Maine. Will be landing in Portland in 2 hours. Look forward to it! #Trump2016

Will miss @RealBenCarson tonight at the #GOPDebate . I hope all of Ben's followers will join the #TrumpTrain . We will never forget.

Go to Trump Doral in Miami and watch the World Golf Championship! On NOW!

The phony lawsuit against Trump U could have been easily settled by me but I want to go to court. 98% approval rating by students. Easy win

Why did Mitt Romney BEG me for my endorsement four years ago?

I am the only one who can beat Hillary Clinton. I am not a Mitt Romney, who doesn't know how to win. Hillary wants no part of "Trump"

Why would the great people of Florida vote for a guy who, as a Senator, never even shows up to vote - worst record. Marco Rubio is a joke!

I have brought millions of people into the Republican Party, while the Dems are going down. Establishment wants to kill this movement!

Failed candidate Mitt Romney,who ran one of the worst races in presidential history,is working with the establishment to bury a big "R" win!

Looks like two-time failed candidate Mitt Romney is going to be telling Republicans how to get elected. Not a good messenger!

Millions of dollars being spent on false TV ads by special interest groups who own Rubio & Cruz.When you see them think of your puppet POLS

"@Johnsmi01433966: The establishment doesn't like you because they can't control you and get you to lie to us and keep ripping us off."

Because of me, the Republican Party has taken in millions of new voters, a record. If they are not careful, they will all leave. Sad!

Just another desperate move by the man who should have easily beaten Barrack Obama. (2/2)

Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney is having a news conference tomorrow to criticize me. (1/2)

. @CNN poll just hit 49% for Trump. Interesting how my numbers have gone so far up since lightweight Marco Rubio has turned nasty. Love it!

Why can't the leaders of the Republican Party see that I am bringing in new voters by the millions-we are creating a larger, stronger party!

Marco Rubio lost big last night. I even beat him in Virginia, where he spent so much time and money. Now his bosses are desperate and angry!

Why would anyone in Florida vote for lightweight Senator Marco Rubio. Check out his credit card scam, his house sale & his no show voting!

The special interests and people who control our politicians (puppets) are spending $25 million on misleading and fraudulent T.V. ads on me.

Thank you Vermont! #Trump2016 #SuperTuesday

Thank you Arkansas! #Trump2016 #SuperTuesday

Thank you Virginia! #Trump2016 #SuperTuesday

Thank you Alabama! #Trump2016 #SuperTuesday

Thank you Tennessee! #Trump2016 #SuperTuesday

Thank you Massachusetts! #Trump2016 #SuperTuesday

Thank you Georgia! #SuperTuesday #Trump2016

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

The people of South Carolina are embarrassed by Nikki Haley!

Got the endorsement of Brian France and @NASCAR yesterday in Georgia. Also, many of the sports great drivers. Thank you Nascar and Georgia!

Great news- Former Mayor of Dallas, Tom Leppert, has just endorsed me! Thank you! Tomorrow is a big day- VOTE! #VoteTrump #SuperTuesday

Trump University has a 98% approval rating. I could have settled but won't out of principle!

My sons, Don and Eric, are on @foxandfriends now 7:35. Great kids, enjoy!

I will be making a big surprise announcement to the massive crowd assembled in Huntsville/Madison Alabama! Landing now! #Trump2016

Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio is polling very poorly in Florida. The people can't stand him for missing so many votes - poor work ethic!

Mitt Romney didn't show his tax return until SEPTEMBER 21, 2012, and then only after being humiliated by Harry R! A bad messenger for estab!

Why would the people of Texas support Ted Cruz when he has accomplished absolutely nothing for them. He is another all talk, no action pol!

Little Marco Rubio, the lightweight no show Senator from Florida, is set to be the "puppet" of the special interest Koch brothers. WATCH!

Making a big speech in Alabama today. So many people we had to move to a football stadium! Come and join us!

I am the only Republican who will get large numbers of Dems and Indies (crossover). I will also get states that no other Republican can get.

While Hillary and I both won South Carolina by big margins, Repubs got far more votes with a massive increase from past cycles.GROWING PARTY

The Republican Establishment has been pushing for lightweight Senator Marco Rubio to say anything to "hit" Trump.I signed the pledge-careful

While I hear the Koch brothers are in big financial trouble (oil), word is they have chosen little Marco Rubio, the lightweight from Florida

Just watched lightweight Marco Rubio lying to a small crowd about my past record. He is not as smart as Cruz, and may be an even bigger liar

. #RogerStone was just banned by @CNN - their loss! Tough, loyal guy.

I started my business with very little and built it into a great company, with some of the best real estate assets in the World. Amazing!

I only wish my wonderful father, Fred, gave me $200 million to start my business like lightweight Rubio says. He didn't - total fabrication!

Fun to watch the Democrats working so hard to win the great State of South Carolina when I just won the Republican version - amazing people!

I am self-funding my campaign and am therefore not controlled by the lobbyists and special interests like lightweight Rubio or Ted Cruz!

Tax experts throughout the media agree that no sane person would give their tax returns during an audit. After the audit, no problem!

I unfairly get audited by the I.R.S. almost every single year. I have rich friends who never get audited. I wonder why?

I will be on @foxandfriends at 8:30 A.M. Will be talking about lightweight Marco Rubio and lying Ted Cruz!

They don't like Rubio in Florida- he left them high & dry. Doesn't even show up for votes!

Lightweight Marco Rubio was working hard last night. The problem is, he is a choker, and once a choker, always a choker! Mr. Meltdown.

Wow, every poll said I won the debate last night. Great honor!

Lightweight choker Marco Rubio looks like a little boy on stage. Not presidential material!

Lying Ted Cruz and lightweight choker Marco Rubio teamed up last night in a last ditch effort to stop our great movement. They failed!

Will be at Fort Worth (Texas) Convention Center at 11:30 A.M. Big crowd - get there early! Big announcement to be made!

Why would the people of Florida vote for Marco Rubio when he defrauded them by agreeing to represent them as their Senator and then quit!

Have a good chance to win Texas on Tuesday. Cruz is a nasty guy, not one Senate endorsement and, despite talk, gets nothing done. Loser!

I will be making a speech at 12:00 in Fort Worth, Texas. Really big crowd expected. Will be talking about the debate last night-plus, plus!

"@WaltSeher: @realDonaldTrump @morg25016893 @eventbrite yup 200 Polish immigrants were hired by his contractor not Trump"

"@Slytle24: @davidaxelrod @realDonaldTrump @CNN he won almost all polls and Mark Halperin gave him an A-

Failed presidential candidate @MittRomney was made to look like a fool by Senator Harry Reid & didn't release his tax returns until 9/21/12.

FMR PRES of Mexico, Vicente Fox horribly used the F word when discussing the wall. He must apologize! If I did that there would be a uproar!

Early on Ted Cruz said that if he didn't win South Carolina, it's over. He didn't win- and lost to me in a landslide!

I'm going to do what @MittRomney was totally unable to do- WIN!

Just for your info, tax returns have 0 to do w/ someone’s net worth. I have already filed my financial statements w/ FEC. They are great!

Why doesn’t @MittRomney just endorse @marcorubio already. Should have done it before NH or Nevada where he had a little sway. Too late now!

Mitt Romney, who was one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics, is now pushing me on tax returns. Dope!

. @RepChrisCollins Chris, thank you so much for your wonderful endorsement. I will not let you down! @CNN

When Ted Cruz quits the race and the field begins to clear, I will get most of his votes - no problem!

Why would Texans vote for "liar" Ted Cruz when he was born in Canada, lived there for 4 years-and remained a Canadian citizen until recently

When Mitt Romney asked me for my endorsement last time around, he was so awkward and goofy that we all should have known he could not win!

Mitt Romney,who totally blew an election that should have been won and whose tax returns made him look like a fool, is now playing tough guy

The polls show that I picked up many Jeb Bush supporters. That is how I got to 46%. When others drop out, I will pick up more. Sad but true

In all of television- the only one who said anything bad about last nights landslide victory-- was dopey @KarlRove . He should be fired!

. @USATODAY Poll and @QuinnipiacPoll say that I beat both Hillary and Bernie, and I havn't even started on them yet!

Big defeat last night in Nevada for Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. @KarlRove on @FoxNews is working hard to belittle my victory. Rove is sick!

@MELANIATRUMP did great on television this morning. Poised, smart and strong, with a big heart - so much to offer. We are all proud of you!

Melania will be interviewed by @morningmika on @Morning_Joe now (8:30 A.M.). ENJOY!

Make sure you get on the Trump line and are not mislead by the Cruz people. They are bad! BE CAREFUL.

GO VOTE FROM NOW TO 8:30 P.M. NEVADA. I WILL BE AT VARIOUS CAUCUS SITES. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

My wife Melania will be on @Morning_Joe tomorrow morning at 8:00. Interviewed by @morningmika - Enjoy!

Club for Growth is the group that came to my office seeking $1 million dollars. I told them no and now they are doing negative ads.

Great. Just reported on @FoxNews that many people who supported @JebBush are now supporting me. I knew that would happen, pundits didn't!

Wow, great Ohio poll. Shows me leading by 5 points, beating K!

Unlike the other Republican candidates, I will be in Nevada all day and night - I won't be fleeing, in and out. I love & invest in Nevada!

I am growing the Republican Party tremendously - just look at the numbers, way up! Democrats numbers are significantly down from years past.

Ted Cruz lifts the Bible high into the air and then lies like a dog-over and over again! The Evangelicals in S.C. figured him out & said no!

Ted Cruz does not have the right "temperment" to be President. Look at the way he totally panicked in firing his director of comm. BAD!

Wow was Ted Cruz disloyal to his very capable director of communication. He used him as a scape goat-fired like a dog! Ted panicked.

Ted Cruz only talks tough on immigration now because he did so badly in S.C. He is in favor of amnesty and weak on illegal immigration.

Ted Cruz said on @oreillyfactor that illegals sent out of country by my administration would come right back as citizens. Another lie-crazy!

A big fat hit job on @oreillyfactor tonight. A total waste of time to watch, boring and biased. @brithume said I would never run, a dope!

Great Town Hall tonight at 10:00 P.M. (Eastern) conducted by @seanhannity on @FoxNews

Thank you Michigan! #VoteTrumpMI Trump 35% Kasich 17% Cruz 12% Rubio 12% Carson 9% Via: ARG

Great poll! Thank you North Carolina! #VoteTrumpNC on 3/15! Trump 36% Cruz 18% Rubio 18% Carson 10% Kasich 7% Via @SurveyUSA

Just watched the very incompetent Mitt Romney Campaign Strategist, Stuart Stevens. Now I know why Mitt lost so badly. Stevens is a clown!

Thank you Illinois! Great news! #VoteTrumpIL on 3/15! Trump 28% Cruz 15% Rubio 14% Kasich 13% Bush 8% Carson 6% Simon Poll/SIU

Ted Cruz should be disqualified from his fraudulent win in Iowa. Weak RNC and Republican leadership probably won't let this happen! Sad.

Just saw the phony ad by Cruz - totally false, more dirty tricks. He got caught in so many lies - is this man crazy?

Ted Cruz has now apologized to Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for fraud and dirty tricks. No wonder he has lost Evangelical support!

Ted Cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false - no basis in fact. Take ad down Ted. Biggest liar in politics!

Wow, Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire his Communications Director. More dirty tricks!

It is so important to audit The Federal Reserve, and yet Ted Cruz missed the vote on the bill that would allow this to be done.

Many people are now saying I won South Carolina because of the last debate. I showed anger and the people of our country are very angry!

I hear the Rickets family, who own the Chicago Cubs, are secretly spending $'s against me. They better be careful, they have a lot to hide!

The reason that Ted Cruz lost the Evangelicals in S.C. is because he is a world class LIAR, and Evangelicals do not like liars!

I am in Las Vegas, at the best hotel (by far), Trump International. I will be working with my wonderful teams and volunteers to WIN Nevada!

A number of months ago, I was not expected to win South Carolina,Ted Cruz was, and yet I won in a landslide - every group and category. WIN!

The failing @WSJ Wall Street Journal should fire both its pollster and its Editorial Board. Seldom has a paper been so wrong.Totally biased!

I will be live on all of the major morning talk shows. Enjoy!

Thank you @SarahPalinUSA for your amazing help and support. Big win, leaving now for Atlanta and Nevada.The people of South Carolina got it!

What a great night. Thank you South Carolina, a special place with truly amazing people! LOVE

People (pundits) gave me no chance in South Carolina. Now it looks like a possible win. I would be happy with a one vote victory! (HOPE)

South Carolina voters have the future of our country in their hands. Vote now (today), and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Remember that Marco Rubio is very weak on illegal immigration. South Carolina needs strength as illegals and Syrians pour in. Don't allow it

I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque? Very sad that he did not go!

I am the only candidate (in many years) who is self-funding his campaign. Lobbyists and $ interests totally control all other candidates!

Lying #Ted Cruz just (on election day) came out with a sneak and sleazy Robocall. He holds up the Bible but in fact is a true lowlife pol!

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Just finished two major speeches in South Carolina. Big crowds, great people. Going for a third now!

Boycott all Apple products until such time as Apple gives cellphone info to authorities regarding radical Islamic terrorist couple from Cal

Hopefully others will follow suit. Our country needs & should demand security. It is time to get tough & be smart!

I use both iPhone & Samsung. If Apple doesn't give info to authorities on the terrorists I'll only be using Samsung until they give info.

Remember, Cruz and Bush gave us Roberts who upheld #ObamaCare twice! I am the only one who will #MAKEAMERICAGREATAGAIN !

I’m self-funding and I am going to take care of the people – not the special interests and insurance companies like the other candidates.

I will replace it with private plans, health savings accounts, & allow purchasing across state lines. Maximum choice & freedom for consumer.

I was referring to a backstop for pre-existing conditions. I will eliminate the law, in its entirety, & replace it w/ something much better.

I was asked about healthcare by Anderson Cooper & have been consistent- I will repeal all of #ObamaCare , including the mandate, period.

Tonight I will be on @FoxNews with @SeanHannity at 10pm and @CNN w/ @AndersonCooper at 10:10pm. Enjoy! #VoteTrumpSC #Trump2016

I agree with Marco Rubio that Ted Cruz is a liar!

. @FoxNews is changing their theme from "fair and balanced" to "unfair and unbalanced." But dying @WSJ is worse.Their phony poll is a joke!

New CBS National Poll just out - massive lead for Trump. The Wall Street Journal/NBC Poll is a total joke. No wonder WSJ is doing so badly!

I love being in South Carolina. We are leading big in all of the State polls - Saturday is a BIG day. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

The just out USA Today National Poll, where I lead by big numbers, shows that in a head to head matchup, I beat both Hillary and Bernie.

Amazing that while I lead by big numbers in the new Q and and USA Today polls, the the press only wants to report on the phony WSJ/NBC poll.

Jeb Bush just got contact lenses and got rid of the glasses. He wants to look cool, but it's far too late. 1% in Nevada!

Just out Nevada poll shows Jeb Bush at 1%, he should take his dumb mouthpiece, @LindseyGrahamSC , and just go home.

. @FoxNews is so biased it is disgusting. They do not want Trump to win. All negative!

I will beat Hillary easily, but Lindsey Graham says I won't, and yet he got zero against me- no cred! Why does FOX put him on?

. @lindseygraham , who had zero in his presidential run before dropping out in disgrace- saying the most horrible things about me on @FoxNews .

Interesting how President Obama so haltingly said I "would never be president" - This from perhaps the worst president in U.S. history!

Why does @megynkelly devote so much time on her shows to me, almost always negative? Without me her ratings would tank. Get a life Megyn!

Thank you @kayleighmcenany for your nice words - great knowledge and style! We are doing really well in South Carolina. @CNN @donlemon

. @brithume thinks that when Republicans drop out of the race, someone will pick up ALL of that vote. The fact is I will get much of it!

Explain to @brithume and @megynkelly , who know nothing, that I will beat Hillary and win states (and dem-indie votes) that no other R can!

Will be interviewed by @StephenAtHome tonight by phone- a late show first @CBS @colbertlateshow . Enjoy! #Colbert #LSSC

Just sat down for a great interview with @PHussionWYFF in Greenville today. Watch at 5pm. An amazing day in South Carolina! #VoteTrumpSC

New PPP Poll just out - Trump up big, Cruz, Rubio and Bush down. The debate results, even with a stacked RNC audience, were wonderful!

Spent the full day at meetings and a major rally yesterday in South Carolina. Great people and spirit. Today will be more of the same.

I'd like to call JEB a liar, but the truth is he has no clue & never revealed that he used Eminent Domain- when criticizing me! (1/2)

Now that George Bush is campaigning for Jeb(!), is he fair game for questions about World Trade Center, Iraq War and eco collapse? Careful!

I will be in South Carolina all week. Saturday is BIG, BIG, BIG! Get out and vote - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN

Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz are not electable presidential candidates, Hillary would destroy them. Ted may not be eligible to run - born in Canada

Funny that Jeb(!) didn't want help from his family in his failed campaign and didn't even want to use his last name.Then mommy, now brother!

Ted Cruz, along with Jeb Bush, pushed Justice John Roberts onto the Supreme Court. Roberts could have killed ObamaCare twice, but didn't!

Wow, in the new CBS Poll I went way up into the forties! Thank you!

Tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists & special interests - the bosses!

Loved the debate last night, and almost everyone said I won, but the RNC did a terrible job of ticket distrbution. All donors & special ints

I will be on Face the Nation with John Dickerson on CBS this morning. Enjoy!

Even though every poll, Time, Drudge etc., has me winning the debate by a lot, @FoxNews only puts negative people on. Biased - a total joke!

Hey @glennbeck - see how I beat your boy Ted- in your own Blaze poll? Your endorsement means nothing! #GOPDebate

All polls have me winning debate big- Drudge, TIME, etc. Dopey Charles Krauthammer still nasty. He has zero cred- totally dishonest!

How can @JebBush beat Hillary Clinton- if he can't beat anyone else on the #GOPDebate stage with $150M? I am the only one who can!

Lightweight @JebBush said tonight he didn't know his family used private eminent domain in Texas- Lie! #GOPDebate

Ted Cruz is a cheater! He holds the Bible high and then lies and misrepresents the facts!

Nasty Ted Cruz is at it again- same dirty tricks he used w/ @RealBenCarson - saying I may not be on ballot & I hold liberal positions. LIES!

Wow! Honored to be chosen by the highly respected + accurate Washington & Lee Mock Convention. I hope you are right - I will make you proud!

The totally unexpected loss of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is a massive setback for the Conservative movement and our COUNTRY!

Love the people of South Carolina - look very much forward to the debate tonight.

A very big thank you to Bill Donohue, head of The Catholic League, for the wonderful interview on @CNN and article in Newsmax! Great insight

Totally unauthorized, do not pay. I am self funding my campaign! Notice has just been withdrawn. #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

The RNC, which is probably not on my side, just illegally put out a fundraising notice saying Trump wants you to contribute to the RNC.

Just got back from Tampa. It was an amazing evening with an even more amazing crowd - fantastic people! Will be in South Carolina tomorrow.

Word is that little Morty Zuckerman’s @NYDailyNews loses more than $50 million per year---can that be possible?

When little Morty Zuckerman closes his failing @NYDailyNews will I at least be given some credit? Will happen soon.

11,000 inside venue tonight in Tampa! Broke record set by Elton John in 1988 w/out musical instruments! Another 5,000 outside. Will be back!

Millions of $'s of false ads, paid for by lobbyists-special interests of cheater @SenTedCruz and sleepy @JebBush , are now running in S.C.

" @by @tedcruz good I want to see the court decide what I was always told "natural born" means - born on American soil"

Last time lightweight @JebBush tried to knock off @marcorubio he made a total fool of himself. If he doesn't do better this time, he is out!

If @TedCruz doesn’t clean up his act, stop cheating, & doing negative ads, I have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen.

Lightweight @JebBush is spending a fortune of special interest against me in SC. False advertising- desperate and sad!

After hearing the news that they would not be able to extort $1M from me, they went hostile w/ a series of incorrect & ill-informed ads.

Nothing conservative about the Club for Growth coming into my office and demanding a $1M contribution, which naturally, they did not get.

The failing @NYDailyNews , destroyed by little Morty Zuckerman, is preparing to close and save face by going online. It's dead!

How can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest?

Lying Cruz put out a statement, “Trump & Rubio are w/Obama on gay marriage." Cruz is the worst liar, crazy or very dishonest. Perhaps all 3?

Just landed in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Reports are out that lines are three quarters of a mile to get in. Wow! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Heading to Baton Rouge, Louisiana for a speech. Expecting a very large crowd! See you soon. #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

We are getting reports from many voters that the Cruz people are back to doing very sleazy and dishonest "pushpolls" on me. We are watching!

Jeb failed as Jeb! He gave up and enlisted Mommy and his brother (who got us into the quicksand of Iraq). Spent $120 million.Weak-no chance!

He (or she) who hesitates is lost: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Remember, it was the Republican Party, with the help of Conservatives, that made so many promises to their base, BUT DIDN'T KEEP THEM! Hi DT

. @MarkHalperin showed a focus group on @Morning_Joe me using a very bad word. I never said the word, left an open blank. Please apologize!

Jeb Bush spent more than $40,000,000 in New Hampshire to come in 4 or 5, I spent $3,000,000 to come in 1st. Big difference in capability!

There are no buyers for the worthless @NYDailyNews but little Mort Zuckerman is frantically looking. It is bleeding red ink - a total loser!

I have been consistent in my opposition to Common Core. Get rid of Common Core--- keep education local!

I was referring to the fact that Jeb Bush wants to keep common core.

Big speech tonight in South Carolina - 7:00 P.M. Tremendous crowd!

So funny, Jeb Bush called me a "highly gifted politician and a great entertainer" - I assume that is a compliment!

Such a great experience in New Hampshire - amazing people! Will be leaving for a big event in South Carolina today.

Like the worthless @NYDailyNews , looks like @politico will be going out of business. Bad reporting- no money, no cred!

Worthless @NYDailyNews , which dopey Mort Zuckerman, is desperately trying to sell, has no buyer! Liabilities are massive!

Dopey Mort Zuckerman, owner of the worthless @NYDailyNews , has a major inferiority complex. Paper will close soon!

Thank you to the people of New Hampshire, I love you! Now, off to South Carolina.

We will stop heroin and other drugs from coming into New Hampshire from our open southern border. We will build a WALL and have security.

We will immediately repeal and replace ObamaCare - and nobody can do that like me. We will save $'s and have much better healthcare!

ISIS is making big threats today - no respect for U.S.A. or our "leader" - If I win it will be a very different story,with very fast results

New Hampshire vote today - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:40. A.M. Enjoy!

The polls are now showing that I am the best to win the GENERAL ELECTION. States that are never in play for Repubs will be won by me. Great!

No-one has done more for people with disabilities than me. I have spent many millions of dollars to help out-and am happy to have done so!

I know the "Governors" and Jeb Bush, who has gone nasty with lies, is by far the weakest of the lot. His family used private eminent domain!

Remember @JebBush wants COMMON CORE (education from D.C.) and is very weak on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ("come as act of love"). Not a leader!

Now that Bush has wasted $120 million of special interest money on his failed campaign, he says he would end super PACs. Sad!

Everybody is laughing at Jeb Bush-spent $100 million and is at bottom of pack. A pathetic figure!

Jeb Bush is desperate - strongly in favor of #CommonCore and very weak on illegal immigration.

Jeb Bush has zero communication skills so he spent a fortune of special interest money on a Super Bowl ad. He is a weak candidate!

My two wonderful sons, Don and Eric, will be on @foxandfriends at 7:02 - now! Enjoy.

So far the Super Bowl is very boring - not nearly as exciting as politics - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I am in New Hampshire having a great time! Loved the #GOPDebate last night! Everybody enjoy the Super Bowl. #SuperBowlSunday #SB50

I am on @foxandfriends now! Tune in!

I will be on State of the Union @CNN with @jaketapper at 9am. Enjoy!

I love New Hampshire - will be an exciting evening!

Wow, Jeb Bush, whose campaign is a total disaster, had to bring in mommy to take a slap at me. Not nice!

Really dumb @CheriJacobus . Begged my people for a job. Turned her down twice and she went hostile. Major loser, zero credibility!

Heading to South Carolina, really big crowd! Will be back in New Hampshire tomorrow. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Such great support in New Hampshire. So many people are working so hard to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain !

I very much look forward to tomorrow’s debate in New Hampshire—so many things to say, so much at stake. It will be an incredible evening!

Big storm in New Hampshire. Moved my event to Monday. Will be there next four days.

Watch @AC360 on NOW! @CNN

I will be interviewed by Anderson Cooper at 8pm on @CNN from New Hampshire. Should be very interesting!

. @oreillyfactor @KarlRove - as per the show, an even more serious Cruz charge is the fraudulent voter violation certificate sent to everyone.

Thank you @billoreilly & @KarlRove . Ted Cruz should be immediately disqualified in Iowa, with each candidate moving up one notch.

Sanders says he wants to run against me because he doesn't want to run against me. He would be so easy to beat!

Dr. Ben Carson blasted Ted Cruz for "deceit and dirty tricks and lies."

Cruz just lied again- I am, and have been totally against #ObamaCare - repeal and replace!

The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud!

I will be interviewed on @greta at 7:00 P.M. Enjoy! @FoxNews

Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.

And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and "choice" - a total lie!

The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud

Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.

During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz.

Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!

Great job on @donlemon tonight @kayleighmcenany @cherijacobus begged us for a job. We said no and she went hostile. A real dummy! @CNN

Anybody who watched all of Ted Cruz's far too long, rambling, overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his Howard Dean moment!

" @stephbewitching @realDonaldTrump All you haters need to realize Trump got the second highest vote in history. And he's never held office!"

" @restorereality Iowa is meaningless...keep pushing forward, run the table in NH SC NV and Super Tuesday. America needs you! #TrumpTrain "

" @ellenEspence @realDonaldTrump Amazing job in Iowa! Cruz just barely won."

" @93101Dianne @realDonaldTrump if you can do that well in Iowa then I see you acing it in all other significant states. Momentum is growing"

" @LoreWestphal @realDonaldTrump You MUST win the Presidency in 2016 !!!"

. @Morning_Joe @mikebarnicle on @realDonaldTrump : He finished 2nd but he made the turn successfully like a pro"

I don't believe I have been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign, the only one. I will keep doing, but not worth it!

I will be talking about my wonderful experience in Iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the media-later in New Hampshire. Big crowd

The media has not covered my long-shot great finish in Iowa fairly. Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history!

Because I was told I could not do well in Iowa, I spent very little there - a fraction of Cruz & Rubio. Came in a strong second. Great honor

My experience in Iowa was a great one. I started out with all of the experts saying I couldn't do well there and ended up in 2nd place. Nice

It all begins today - WE WILL FINALLY TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK AND MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

So nice to get an endorsement from the founder and owner of Pizza Ranch in Iowa! A great guy and great places! #CaucusForTrump

I will be interviewed on Face The Nation with @jdickerson this morning. Enjoy!

I am in Iowa. Will be interviewed on This Week With @GStephanopoulos this morning. ENJOY!

If I would have done the last debate, a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings recieved). Also, VETS got $6,000,000.

By not doing the failed, poorly rated debate, I was able to make the point of not allowing "unfairness" - while raising $6,000,000 for VETS.

Wow, just saw an ad - Cruz is lying on so many levels. There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me, will repeal & replace. He lies!

Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form. Very low interest loans, scam!

Ted Cruz is totally unelectable, if he even gets to run (born in Canada). Will loose big to Hillary. Polls show I beat Hillary easily! WIN!

I will be going to church in Iowa this morning with my wife, Melania. After church I will be making two speeches and touring the State!

. @bobvanderplaats is a total phony and con man. When I wouldn't give him free hotel rooms and much more, he endorsed Cruz. @foxandfriends

. @bobvanderplaats asked me to do an event. The people holding the event called me to say he wanted $100,000 for himself.Phony @foxandfriends

. @bobvanderplaats is a total phony and dishonest guy. Asked me for expensive hotel rooms, free (and more). I said pay and he endorsed Cruz!

The Cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters "in violation." They are now under investigation. Bad!

I will be in Iowa all day and until Tuesday morning. Finally, after all these years of watching stupidity, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Hillary Clinton is a major national security risk. Not presidential material!

. @oreillyfactor The people of Iowa love the fact that I stuck up for my rights, as I will do for the U.S. Also got $6,000,000 for our VETS!

. @FoxNews is the only network that does not even mention my very successful event last night. $6,000,000 raised in one hour for our VETS.

Amazing that Ted Cruz can't even get a Senator like @BenSasse , who is easy, to endorse him. Not one Senator is endorsing Canada Ted!

. @BenSasse looks more like a gym rat than a U.S. Senator. How the hell did he ever get elected? @greta

The great State of Nebraska can do much better than @BenSasse as your Senator. Saw him on @greta - totally ineffective. Wants paid for pols.

The new e-mail release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton. At a minimum, how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president?

They say that if I participated in last night’s Fox debate, they would have had 12 million more & would have broken the all time record.

Getting ready to take off for Nashua, New Hampshire. Big crowd, will be there soon. Fun!

Iowa was amazing last night. The event could not have worked out better. We raised $6,000,000 for our great vets. They were so happy & proud

Thank you for the kind words tonight, @OMAROSA . You were great! See you soon!

An unbelievable night in Iowa with our great Veterans! We raised $6,000,000.00 while the politicians talked! #GOPDebate

Watching biased Charles @krauthammer , a @FoxNews flunky who didn't know that I won every debate, in particular- the last one. Check polls!

I hear that @SenTedCruz ’s $$ man, Robert Mercer, a good man, is very angry because Cruz lied to him about liquidating his (Ted’s) holdings.?

The "debate" tonight will be a total disaster - low ratings with advertisers and advertising rates dropping like a rock. I hate to see this.

Wow, two candidates called last night and said they want to go to my event tonight at Drake University.

On Greta, 87% of the people said they would not watch the debate if I'm not in it. Wow- what an honor!

FOX debate advertising rates falling like a rock! Tune into my special event for the Veterans at 9pm EST!

It was the childishly written & taunting PR statement by Fox that made me not do the debate, more so than lightweight reporter, @megynkelly .

I will be interviewed on @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:00 P.M. (Eastern). Enjoy!

Even though I beat him in the first six debates, especially the last one, Ted Cruz wants to debate me again. Can we do it in Canada?

Just got to listen to Rush Limbaugh - the guy is fantastic!

The statement put out yesterday by @FoxNews was a disgrace to good broadcasting and journalism. Who would ever say something so nasty & dumb

I refuse to call Megyn Kelly a bimbo, because that would not be politically correct. Instead I will only call her a lightweight reporter!

Do you think @SenTedCruz knows about @bobvanderplaats dealings? Actually, I doubt it!

. @bobvanderplaats begged me to do an event while asking organizers for $100,000 for himself—a bad guy!

Great honor- Rev. Jerry Falwell Jr. of Liberty University, one of the most respected religious leaders in our nation, has just endorsed me!

Why doesn't phony @bobvanderplaats tell his followers all the times he asked for him and his family to stay at my hotels-didn't like paying

I will be interviewed by @MariaBartiromo on @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness at 7:30 A.M. Enjoy.

I will be doing @GMA @GStephanopoulos this morning at around 7:00. Likewise, I will be doing @Morning_Joe at around 7:00. Figure it out!

Just landed in New Hampshire. Will be at the venue shortly. #FITN

" @realDonaldTrump & @HillaryClinton leading POLLS w/ one week until #IowaCaucus ...MORE on the 2016 elections TONIGHT on @FoxBusiness 7PM"

Leaving now for New Hampshire. Big crowd- looking forward to it! #FITN

Cruz lies are almost as bad as Jeb's. These politicians will do anything to stay at the trough!

Cruz going down fast in recent polls- dropping like a rock. Lies never work!

Ted Cruz is a nervous wreck. He is making reckless charges not caring for the truth! His poll #'s are way down!

I will be on @CNNSitRoom with @wolfblitzer from 5-7pm est. on @CNN .

I will be on Morning's with Maria on the Fox Business Network tomorrow during the 7am and 8am ET hours.

I will be on The Situation Room with @wolfblitzer from 5-7pm est on CNN

It's time for Ted Cruz to either settle his problem with the FACT that he was born in Canada and was a citizen of Canada, or get out of race

I will be on Face The Nation this morning at various times across the U.S. @CBSNews Enjoy!

I will be on @meetthepress this morning at various times across the U.S. @NBCNews Enjoy!

Word is that crying @GlennBeck left the GOP and doesn't have the right to vote in the Republican primary. Dumb as a rock.

Just left a great event in Pella. Going to church tomorrow in Muscatine, Iowa.

I will be on FOX with the great @JudgeJeanine tonight at 9pm EST! Enjoy! #Trump2016

. @williebosshog such an honor to get your endorsement. You are a fantastic guy! It will not be forgotten. Don and Eric say hello!

Heading now to Pella, Iowa. Big crowd! Remember, Trump is a big buyer of Pella windows. See you soon!

Just left Sioux Center, Iowa. My speech was very well received. Truly great people! Packed house- overflow!

Based on @MegynKelly 's conflict of interest and bias she should not be allowed to be a moderator of the next debate.

Heading to Sioux County, Iowa, where the crowd is amazing. Dr. Robert Jeffress will make the introduction. Make America Great Again!

Ted Cruz poll numbers are down big. Because he was born in Canada and was, until recently, a Canadian citizen, many believe he cannot run!

I am in Iowa watching all of these phony T.V. ads by the other candidates. All bull, politicians are all talk and no action-it won't happen!

. @AnnCoulter has been amazing. We will win and establish strong borders, we will build a WALL and Mexico will pay. We will be great again!

I am in Iowa. Will be making two speeches today. Good luck to all of the great folks on the East coast. Enjoy the beauty of the storm!

Is Cruz honest? He is in bed w/ Wall St. & is funded by Goldman Sachs/Citi, low interest loans. No legal disclosure & never sold off assets.

Cruz did not renounce his Canadian citizenship as a US Senator- only when he started to run for #POTUS . He could be Canadian Prime Minister.

Cruz says I supported TARP, which gave $25 million to Goldman Sachs, the bank which loaned him the money he didn't disclose. Puppet!

The only reason irrelevant @GlennBeck doesn't like me is I refused to do his failing show - asked many times. Very few listeners - sad!

. @BrentBozell , one of the National Review lightweights, came to my office begging for money like a dog. Why doesn't he say that?

Just watched Jeb's ad where he desperately needed mommy to help him. Jeb --- mom can't help you with ISIS, the Chinese or with Putin.

Ted Cruz went down big in just released Reuters poll - what's going on? Is it Goldman Sachs/Citi loans or Canada?

Rush Limbaugh is great, tells it as he sees it---really honorable guy! Thanks Rush! #Trump2016

The tax scam Washington Post does among the most inaccurate stories of all. Really dishonest reporting.

Wow! New National Zogby Poll just out:.TRUMP 45. CRUZ 13. RUBIO 8. Big numbers.

Leaving Nevada now for Iowa. Things are looking good - great new polls!

The dying @NRO National Review has totally given up the fight against Barrack Obama. They have been losing for years. I will beat Hillary!

After spending $89 million, @JebBush is at the bottom of the barrel in polls. He is ashamed to use the name "Bush" in ads. Low energy guy!

The failing @NRO National Review Magazine has just been informed by the Republican National Committee that they cannot participate in debate

Highly respected Constitutional law professor Mary Brigid McManamon has just stated, "Ted Cruz is not eligible to be President." Big problem

Ted Cruz complains about my views on eminent domain, but without it we wouldn't have roads, highways, airports, schools or even pipelines.

The late, great, William F. Buckley would be ashamed of what had happened to his prize, the dying National Review!

Very few people read the National Review because it only knows how to criticize, but not how to lead.

National Review is a failing publication that has lost it's way. It's circulation is way down w its influence being at an all time low. Sad!

Why does @Greta have a fired Bushy like dummy, John Sununu on- spewing false info? I will beat Hillary by a lot, she wants no part of Trump.

Happy birthday to my friend, the great @jacknicklaus - a totally special guy!

New Day on CNN treats me very badly. @AlisynCamerota is a disaster. Not going to watch anymore.

Low energy candidate @JebBush has wasted $80 million on his failed presidential campaign. Millions spent on me. He should go home and relax!

Sad sack @JebBush has just done another ad on me, with special interest money, saying I won't beat Hillary - I WILL. But he can't beat me.

So sad that @CNN and many others refused to show the massive crowd at the arena yesterday in Oklahoma. Dishonest reporting!

Wacko @glennbeck is a sad answer to the @SarahPalinUSA endorsement that Cruz so desperately wanted. Glenn is a failing, crying, lost soul!

“Palin’s brand among evangelicals is as gold as the faucets in Trump tower,” said Ralph Reed, the chairman of the Faith & Freedom Coalition.

Wow, the highly respected Governor of Iowa just stated that "Ted Cruz must be defeated." Big shoker! People do not like Ted.

. @FreeJesseJames - Just read your complete statement. You are an amazing guy & I really appreciate your words & support. I will see you soon!

Really disgusting that the failing New York Times allows dishonest writers to totally fabricate stories.

Dope Frank Bruni said I called many people, including Karl Rove, losers-true! I never called my friend @HowardStern a loser- he’s a winner!

Wow, new polls just out have Trump up and Cruz down - he is a nervous wreck!

. @TheBrodyFile great job on @AC360 . Thank you for the very smart and kind words!

I don't think Ted Cruz can even run for President until he can assure Republican voters that being born in Canada is not a problem. Doubt!

Ted Cruz is falling in the polls. He is nervous. People are worried about his place of birth and his failure to report his loans from banks!

Leaving for Liberty University. I'll be speaking today in front of a record crowd. #Trump2016

I am self-funding my campaign - putting up my own money, not controlled. Cruz is spending $millions on ads paid for by his N.Y. bosses.

Far more killed than anticipated in radical Islamic terror attack yesterday. Get tough and smart U.S., or we won't have a country anymore!

Iran is going to buy 114 jetliners with a small part of the $150 billion we are giving them...but they won't buy from U.S., rather Airbus!

In Iran deal we get 4 prisoners. They get $150 billion, 7 most wanted and many off watch list. This will create great incentive for others!

Wow! Ted Cruz received $487K in campaign contributions, $11M from a NY hedge fund mogul, & $1M low int. loan from Goldman Sachs. Hypocrite

Greatly dishonest of @TedCruz to file a financial disclosure form & not list his lending banks- then pretend he is going to clean up Wall St

When will @TedCruz give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him.

Everybody that loves the people of New York, and all they have been thru, should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics!

If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage, why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage?

Ted Cruz purposely, and illegally, did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. They own him!

Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a "natural born Canadian," did he borrow unreported loans from C banks?

Oh no, just reported that Ted Cruz didn't report another loan, this one from Citi. Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate.

The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember, his wife's employer, and his lender, is located there!

Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer!

Ted Cruz said he "didn't know" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable

Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago. Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. I told you so

More radical Islam attacks today - it never ends! Strengthen the borders, we must be vigilant and smart. No more being politically correct.

. @FrankLuntz is a total clown. Has zero credibility! @FoxNews @megynkelly

. @oreillyfactor please explain to the very dumb and failing @glennbeck that I supported John McCain big league in 2008, not Obama!

Just got back from Iowa - had a great time with amazing people. Will be back soon!

. @GeraldoRivera Thank you Geraldo for your nice words on @oreillyfactor tonight. You are a true champion! Thank @ericbolling - great guy!

" @GeraldoRivera @SenTedCruz got ass kicked by @realDonaldTrump last night-He offended every New Yorker & has no answer to Natural Born issue

Jusr watched #HarveyPitt on @TeamCavuto - he was great!

Sen. Lindsey Graham embarrassed himself with his failed run for President and now further embarrasses himself with endorsement of Bush.

Jeb Bush, who did poorly last night in the debate and whose chances of winning are zero, just got Graham endorsement. Graham quit at O.

Do you think Iran would have acted so tough if they were Russian sailors? Our country was humiliated.

United States looks more and more like a paper tiger. Won't be that way if I win!

Iran humiliated the United States with the capture of our 10 sailors. Horrible pictures & images. We are weak. I will NOT forget!

Stuart Stevens is a dumb guy who fails @virtually everything he touches. Romney campaign,his book,etc. Why does @andersoncooper put him on?

Why does @CNN & @andersoncooper waste airtime by putting failed campaign strategist, Stuart Stevens - who lost BIG for Romney - on the show?

. @EricTrump - unbelievable job on #FoxNews with @greta . That was better than I could do! #Trump2016

Sadly, there is no way that Ted Cruz can continue running in the Republican Primary unless he can erase doubt on eligibility. Dems will sue!

Iran toys with U.S. days before we pay them, ridiculously, billions of dollars. Don't release money. We want our hostages back NOW!

Numerous polls have me beating Hillary Clinton. In a race with her, voter turnout will be the highest in U.S. history-I get most new voters!

The State Of The Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time. New leadership fast!

Just found out that @tedcruz is spending a fortune on Iowa push polls negative to me. Not nice, but OK! New polls are great.

The #SOTU speech is really boring, slow, lethargic - very hard to watch!

The Iran deal is terrible. Why didn't we get the uranium stockpile - it was sent to Russia. #SOTU

On my way to Cedar Falls, Iowa, now. Will be great--I love the people of Iowa!

The Tonight Show begins in 5 minutes. Enjoy!

. @stuartpstevens horrible advise to Mitt Romney made victory an impossibility. Don't blame Mitt! Now Stevens can't get a job!

Fantastic job on @CNN tonight. @kayleighmcenany is a winner! @donlemon

Don't forget to watch The Tonight Show with the wonderful @jimmyfallon at 11:30 P.M. You will not be disappointed! @NBC

Face The Nation's interview of me was the highest rated show that they have had in 15 years. Congratulations and WOW! @CBSNews @jdickerson

. @MajorCBS Major Garrett of @CBSNews covers me very inaccurately. Total agenda, bad reporter!

Thank you Michael Harrison @Talkersmagazine for your kind words - greatly appreciated!

. @megynkelly recently said that she can’t be wooed by Trump. She is so average in every way, who the hell wants to woo her!

. @RinglingBros is retiring their elephants-- the circus will never be the same.

Congratulations to @jdickerson of Face the Nation on his highest ratings in 15 years. 4.6 million people watched my interview! Thank you!

So professional of @ABC news to throw out the failing @UnionLeader newspaper from their debate. Paper won't survive, highly unethical!

Great job on Fox this morning @KatiePavlich . I am sending out for your book immediately. Thank you very much!

Congratulations to my friend @TheSlyStallone on winning a #GoldenGlobe . A wonderful guy- who has created something special- well deserved!

Why does @ThisWeekABC w/ @GStephanopoulos allow a hater & racist like @tavissmiley to waste good airtime? @ABC can do much better than him!

Union Leader refuses to comment as to why they were kicked out of the ABC News debate like a dog. For starters, try getting a new publisher!

UL has lost all credibility under Joe McQuaid w circulation dropping to record lows. They aren't worthy of representing the great people NH.

This is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates. I said it should not be allowed and ABC agreed.

If their highly unethical behavior, including begging me for ads, isn’t questionable enough, they have endorsed a candidate who can’t win.

Remember, get TIME magazine! I am on the cover. Take it out in 4 years and read it again! Just watch...

Heading now for Reno, Nevada, for a big rally. Good poll numberd all over!

In the just out @FoxNews Poll, I easily beat Hillary Clinton - and I havn't even focused on her yet. On our way: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Yesterday in Iowa was amazing - two speeches in front of two great sold out crowds. They love that I am the only candidate self-funding!

I want to thank the people of Iowa for an unbelievable day. The crowds were amazing. Will be back Tuesday!

Will be on Meet the Press with @ChuckTodd tomorrow morning. Enjoy!

I will be interviewed by Chris Wallace on Fox tomorrow morning. Tune in!

I'm protesting the @UnionLeader from having anything to do w/ ABC debate. Their unethical record doesn't give them the right to be involved!

(1/2) Time Magazine has me on the cover this week. David Von Drehle has written one of the best stories I have ever had.

. @JonahNRO , watched on @seanhannity and appreciate your statements --- I have been waiting for them for a long time. Thank you.

Constitutional law expert #Laurence Tribe of Harvard says "wrong to say it (natural born citizen) is a settled matter-it isn't settled).

South Carolina rally last night was so unbelievably exciting (and fun). I am now off to Iowa for two big rallies - packed houses. Love it!

Pat Buchanan gave a fantastic interview this morning on @CNN - way to go Pat, way ahead of your time!

Great even in SC tonight! Fire Marshall would not let everyone in-- 5,000 turned away. Thank you for coming!

Will be at venue, in wonderful South Carolina, very soon. Big traffic back-up, tremendous crowd! Will be wild.

Love seeing union & non-union members alike are defecting to Trump. I will create jobs like no one else. Their #Dem leaders can’t compete!

I hope all workers demand that their @Teamsters reps endorse Donald J. Trump. Nobody knows jobs like I do! Don’t let them sell you out!

On my way to South Carolina. Big Crowd--- look forward to it!

Hank Greenberg, formerly of AIG, gave $10 million to the @JebBush campaign 3 months ago. He is not happy, a total waste of money!

Great time in Burlington, Vermont. Crowd was amazing.

I'm leaving now for Burlington, Vermont. It will be wild!

Joy Behar, who was fired from her last show for lack of ratings, is even worse on @TheView . We love Barbara!

The @TheView @ABC , once great when headed by @BarbaraJWalters , is now in total freefall. Whoopi Goldberg is terrible. Very sad!

Weak & ineffective @JebBush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response. False advertising!

I have an idea for @JebBush whose campaign is a disaster. Try using your last name and don't be ashamed of it!

. @SenTedCruz Ted--free legal advice on how to pre-empt the Dems on citizen issue. Go to court now & seek Declaratory Judgment--you will win!

Massive crowd in VT tonight. Venue not big enough. Officials say NO to outside event and sound system. Arrive early!

Man shot inside Paris police station. Just announced that terror threat is at highest level. Germany is a total mess-big crime. GET SMART!

I will be in beautiful Burlington, Vermont, tonight for a rally. Will be great fun. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

It was a very wise move that Ted Cruz renounced his Canadian citizenship 18 months ago. Senator John McCain is certainly no friend of Ted!

. @Macys was one of the worst performing stocks on the S&P last year, plunging 46%. Very disloyal company. Another win for Trump! Boycott.

The failing @UnionLeader newspaper in N.H. just sent The Trump Organization a letter asking that we take ads. How stupid, how desperate!

I will be on @wolfblitzer for a @CNNSitRoom interview today. Please join us 5PM ET.

Huge crowd expected tomorrow night! VT Police say first come, first serve. Arrive early!

Don’t like @SamuelLJackson ’s golf swing. Not athletic. I’ve won many club championships. Play him for charity!

I don’t cheat at golf but @SamuelLJackson cheats—with his game he has no choice—and stop doing commercials!

Germany is going through massive attacks to its people by the migrants allowed to enter the country. New Years Eve was a disaster. THINK!

" @longtalltexan20 @realDonaldTrump I love it when TRUMP calls out MSM for what they really are! Cams starting to show crowds at rallies!"

" @Lucky5713 @NewDay What's wrong with showing Morocco? Nothing! It illustrates a Point! Duh! Love the video!"

I don’t know @SamuelLJackson , to best of my knowledge haven't played golf w/him & think he does too many TV commercials—boring. Not a fan.

Wow @UnionLeader circulation in NH has dropped from 75,000 to around 10—bad management. No wonder they begged me for ads.

The rally in Lowell, Massachusetts, was amazing. 10,000 people going wild. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Woody Johnson, owner of the NYJets, is @JebBush ’s finance chairman. If Woody would’ve been w/me, he would’ve been in the playoffs, at least!

I look forward to being in Lowell, Massachusetts, today. I hear a very big crowd is expected--we will have lots of fun!

"@RhettRiley1234: Trump only wins with our votes. we must grow Trump nation and do our part. vote. This is our time.

The worst thing Hillary could do is have her husband campaign for her. Just watch.

Iran, with all of the money and all else given to them by Obama, has wanted a way to take over Saudi Arabia & their oil. THEY JUST FOUND IT!

. @RuthMarcus of the @washingtonpost was terrible today on Face The Nation.No focus, poor level of concentration-but correct on Hillary lying

. @chucktodd said today on @meetthepress that "attacking Bill to get to Hillary has never worked before." Wrong - attacked him in '08 & won!

Does anybody remember when Bill Clinton, in 2008, worked long and hard for Hillary? She LOST! Now Bill is at it again. Just watch.

Hillary said that guns don't keep you safe. If she really believes that she should demand that her heavily armed bodyguards quickly disarm!

Al-Shabbab, not ISIS, just made a video on me - they all will as front-runner & if I speak out against them, which I must. Hillary lied!

Hillary Clinton lied last week when she said ISIS made a D.T. video. The video that ISIS made was about her husband being a degenerate.

Just returned from Mississippi - a great evening.

Just arrived in Mississippi for the rally. Word is that the crowd is overflowing and massive. Will be an amazing evening!

Remember, I am self-funding my campaign, the only one in either party. I'm not controlled by lobbyists or special interests-only the U.S.A.!

When I look at all of the money the special interests and lobbyists are giving to candidates, beware - the candidates are mere puppets $$$$!

I hope Bill Clinton starts talking about women's issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how Hillary abused those women!

Hillary Clinton doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president. Jeb Bush is a low energy individual, but Hillary is not much better!

Hillary Clinton said that it is O.K. to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL, but not O.K. to do so in the U.S. We must be vigilant!

. @JebBush is a low energy "stiff" who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls. Has no chance!

. @JebBush is a sad case. A total embarrassment to both himself and his family, he just announced he will continue to spend on Trump hit ads!

The person that Hillary Clinton least wants to run against is, by far, me. It will be the largest voter turnout ever - she will be swamped!

I will be going to Mississippi tomorrow night - hear the crowds are going to be massive! Look forward to it.

Well, the year has officially begun. I have many stops planned and will be working very hard to win so that we can turn our country around!

I will be on @FoxNews live, with members of my family, at 11:50 P.M. We will ring in the New Year together! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I would like to wish everyone A HAPPY AND HEALTHY NEW YEAR. WE MUST ALL WORK TOGETHER TO, FINALLY, MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN AND GREAT AGAIN!

Do you believe that The State Department, on NEW YEAR'S EVE, just released more of Hillary's e-mails. They just want it all to end. BAD!

I would feel sorry for @JebBush and how badly he is doing with his campaign other than for the fact he took millions of $'s of hit ads on me

People ask, "why do you tweet and re-tweet to millions about @JebBush when he is so low in the polls?" Because of his big $ hit ads on me!

. @JebBush has spent $63,000,000 and is at the bottom of the polls. I have spent almost nothing and am at the top. WIN! @hughhewitt

A GREAT day in South Carolina. Record crowd and fantastic enthusiasm. This is now a movement to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I predict that dying @UnionLeader newspaper, which has been run into the ground by publisher "Stinky" Joe McQuaid, will be dead in 2 years!

I'm going to be live with @ericbolling and @kimguilfoyle to ring in the New Year 2016. Everybody should tune in to @foxnews tomorrow night!

I never thought I'd be saying this but I've really enjoyed @RichLowry on television lately, and he was terrific hosting @seanhannity

Joe McQuaid ( @deucecrew ) is desperately trying to sell the @UnionLeader . It's a loser, and my comments haven't helped him much.

The dying @UnionLeader newspaper in NH is in turmoil over my comments about them- like a bully that got knocked out!

Iowa was fantastic last night, amazing crowd and people. I'm now in Florida, getting ready to go to South Carolina. Big crowd, very exciting

. @CharlesHurt You were great on @seanhannity last night. Thanks for the nice words. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Joe McQuaid ( @deucecrew ) of the dying Union Leader wanted ads, lunches, donations, speeches from me, and tweets---very unethical.

The great people of New Hampshire, who I love, are not properly served by the dying Union Leader newspaper.

Shows how dumb Joe McQuaid ( @deucecrew ) of the dying Union Leader is to put out the letter I wrote saying why I didn't do his failed debate!

I hope @TGowdySC does better for Rubio than he did at the #Benghazi hearings, which were a total disaster for Republicans & America!

Looking forward to being in Council Bluffs, Iowa, later today. Despite weather, rally is on -- will be fantastic! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain !

So, I have spent almost nothing on my run for president and am in 1st place. Jeb Bush has spent $59 million & done. Run country my way!

My campaign for president is $35,000,000 under budget, I have spent very little (and am in 1st place).Now I will spend big in Iowa/N.H./S.C.

I will be interviewed on the @TODAYshow at 7:00 A.M. Talking about the state of the race for president, and more. Enjoy!

. @jessebwatters is terrific at hosting on @FoxNews - he really gets it!

Remember that Bill Clinton was brought in to help Hillary against Obama in 2008. He was terrible, failed badly, and was called a racist!

Strange, but I see wacko Bernie Sanders allies coming over to me because I'm lowering taxes, while he will double & triple them, a disaster!

Wages in are country are too low, good jobs are too few, and people have lost faith in our leaders.We need smart and strong leadership now!

Many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone, shipped to other countries. We now are part time, sad! I WILL FIX!

The middle-class has worked so hard, are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of - and no effective raise in years. BAD

If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband, with his terrible record of women abuse, while playing the women's card on me, she's wrong!

Hopefully the Republican National Committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in Virginia's Republican Party. FAST!

Straighten out The Republican Party of Virginia before it is too late. Stupid! RNC

. @BernieSanders -who blew his campaign when he gave Hillary a pass on her e-mail crime, said that I feel wages in America are too high. Lie!

Why are @JebBush flunkies @ananavarro and @secupp , two of the dumbest people in politics, always on the @CNN panels..and yet Poll:Trump 39

The voters the Republican Party of Virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory. The Dems LOVE IT! Be smart and win for a change!

R.P.Virginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row. Will now not allow desperately needed new voters. Suicidal mistake. RNC MUST ACT NOW!

It begins, Republican Party of Virginia, controlled by the RNC, is working hard to disallow independent, unaffiliated and new voters. BAD!

I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:00. Will be talking about Hillary and far more interesting subjects. Enjoy!

I will do far more for women than Hillary, and I will keep our country safe, something which she will not be able to do-no strength/stamina!

Hillary Clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but HE'S DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT FOR SEXISM, so inappropriate!

A new terror warning was issued for European cties. At what point do we say we have had enough and get really tough and smart. Weak leaders!

Criminal deportations in the U.S. are the lowest number in many years. We are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country. MUST CHANGE!

The Phoenix V.A., it has just been reported, is in worse shape than ever before. The wait is horrendous, and people are dying. I will fix it

The same people that said I wouldn't run, or that I wouldn't lead or do well (1st place and leading by 21%), now say I won't beat Hillary.

. @chucktodd is so dishonest in his reporting...and to think he was going off the air until I came along-no ratings. I will beat Hillary!

@CNN just announced that TRUMP was #1 story of 2015. Totally meaningless, however, if we don't WIN IT ALL and Make America Great Again!

When will the Democrats, and Hillary in particular, say "we must build a wall, a great wall, and Mexico is going to pay for it?" Never!

Our great VETERANS are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the V.A. That will stop, I will fix this quickly!

Remember when failed candidate @JebBush said that illegals came across the border as AN ACT OF LOVE? He's spent $59 million and is at 3%.

We have many problems in our house (country!), and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now, because of me, starting to deport people who are here illegally. Politics!

. @deedeesorvino was GREAT today on @FoxNews She gets what is going on in politics, and sees it very clearly. Have her on more!

Merry Christmas to all. Have a great day and have a really amazing year. Together, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! It will be done!

. @danielhalper Great job on @CNN today. Very wise indeed!

. @HallieJackson Why didn't you report Hillary lying about the ISIS video. Bad reporting. Perhaps @NBC will do better next year-but doubt it!

I am now in Palm Beach, Florida, and will be going to church tonight. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

. @meetthepress and @chucktodd very dishonest in not showing the new @CNN Poll where I am at 39%, 21points higher than Cruz. Be honest Chuck!

Why isn't @chucktodd using the much newer @CNN Poll when discussing how well I am doing instead of the older Q Poll? CNN even better!

Wow, because of the pressure put on by me, ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS. It's about time!

Next year will be an interesting one. I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton, a totally flawed candidate, and beating her soundly

Third rate reporters Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the failing @nytimes are totally in the Hillary circle of bias. Think about Bill!

Wow, even lowly Rand Paul has just past @JebBush in the new @CNN Poll. Jeb is at 3%, I'm at 39%. Stop throwing your money down the drain!

In the ridiculous @JebBush ad about me, Jeb is speaking to me during the debate, but doesn't allow my answer, which destroys him - SO SAD!

Poor @JebBush spent $50 million on his campaign, I spent almost nothing. He's bottom (and gone), I'm top (by a lot). That's what U.S. needs!

Hillary said "I really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign." I deplore the death and destruction she caused-stupidity

Hillary, when you complain about "a penchant for sexism," who are you referring to. I have great respect for women. BE CAREFUL!

It is hard to believe I am winning by so much when I am treated so badly by the media. New @CNN Poll amazing in ALL categories. 21 pt. Lead

Why does @FoxNews give @KarlRove so much airtime. He (and other Fox pundits) is so biased. Still thinks Romney won. Unfair coverage of Trump

. @FoxNews treats me so badly. Using old Quinnipiac Poll where I have a much smaller lead than the just out @CNN Poll. All negative!

The @washingtonpost , which is the lobbyist (power) for not imposing taxes on #Amazon , today did a nasty cartoon attacking @tedcruz kids. Bad

The Hillary Clinton staged event yesterday was pathetic. Be careful Hillary as you play the war on women or women being degraded card.

Big news just out - NEW @CNN POLL TRUMP 39 and leads in every major category. Likeability way up. CRUZ 18 CARSON 10 RUBIO 10

We need a PRESIDENT with strength, stamina, heart and incredible deal making skill if our country is ever going to be able to prosper again!

It is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong. Sad!

When I said that Hillary Clinton got schlonged by Obama, it meant got beaten badly. The media knows this. Often used word in politics!

Wow, new Reuters Poll just out. Big lead if you want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! TRUMP 37 CRUZ 11 This is at the top of Drudge!

For those on TV defending my use of the word "schlonged," bc #MSM is giving it false meaning-tell them it means beaten badly. Dishonest #MSM

NPR's @NealConan said "schlonged" to WaPo re: 1984 Mondale/Ferraro campaign: "That ticket went on to get schlonged at the polls." #Hypocrisy

Once again, #MSM is dishonest. "Schlonged" is not vulgar. When I said Hillary got "schlonged" that meant beaten badly.

Jeb's big ad buy against me, paid for by lobbyists, shows my face but doesn't have me answering Jeb's statements. He is really pathetic!

Watching @CNN and consider @secupp to be one of the least talented people on television. Boring and biased!

. @JebBush 's opening and closing in the debate were said by all to be terrible--fumbled around, incoherent.

Why doesn't @JebBush , in his ads, show my answer to his statement in the debate?

Will @JebBush , in his phony advertising campaign, show himself asking me to apologize to his wife in the debate?

. @JebBush just took millions of $'s in special interest money to look like a tough guy. Will never work!

Weak and low energy @JebBush , whose campaign is a disaster, is now doing ads against me where he tries to look like a tough guy.

"@_MSFL_: @realDonaldTrump @TrumpUSA16 A GREAT PATRIOT"

@HerschelWalker , thanks for your support- it is very much appreciated!

Getting ready to leave for Michigan - will be an amazing evening! See you there.

Do you think that Hillary Clinton will apologize to me for the lie she told about "the video" of me being used by ISIS. There is no video.

Thanks @AndreaTantaros for all of your kind words and thoughts. Big progress is being made. Keep up the great work!

A suicide bomber has just killed U.S. troops in Afghanistan. When will our leaders get tough and smart. We are being led to slaughter!

It's the Democrats' total weakness & incompetence that gave rise to ISIS -- not a tape of Donald Trump that was an admitted Hillary lie!

Getting ready to go to the great State of Michigan. Big crowd tonight. Make America Great Again!

Just out: TRUMP GOP DEBATE - 18,000,000. CLINTON DEMOCRAT DEBATE - 6,700,000. And they were on major network vs. cable!

Hillary said with respect to ISIS, "we are finally where we need to be." Do we want 4 more years of incompetent leadership? MAGA!

I demand an apology from Hillary Clinton for the disgusting story she made up about me for purposes of the debate. There never was a video.

Hillary said at debate ISIS is "going to people showing videos in order to recruit more radical jihadistst." She made up story-want apology!

Very sad what happened last night at the Miss Universe Pageant. I sold it 6 months ago for a record price. This would never have happened!

. @JebBush today said he didn't want to be the front-runner, he would rather be where he is now, 2%. That is the talk of a loser, can't win!

. @MissUniverse final 3 on now. Great people, great new owner @IMG . WATCH.

My friend, @AriEmanuel of @IMG , bought the Miss Universe pageants from me and they are on tonight on #Fox ! Tune in!

It was really strange when Hillary was missing from the podium last night. Not very presidential!

Hillary Clinton spokesperson admitted that their was no ISIS video of me. Therefore, Hillary LIED at the debate last night. SAD!

. @JebBush was terrible on Face The Nation today. Being at 2% and falling seems to have totally affected his confidence. A basket case!

Hillary Clinton lied when she said that "ISIS is using video of Donald Trump as a recruiting tool." This was fact checked by @FoxNews : FALSE

. @jonkarl was totally misled, and he fell for it, that Hillary wants to run against me. She knows that I am her worst nightmare-Jon doesn't!

. @GStephanopoulos stupidly believes that Hillary wants to run against me because she said so. She says that so people believe it - opposite!

President Obama spends so much time speaking of the so-called Carbon footprint, and yet he flies all the way to Hawaii on a massive old 747.

See, Sanders backed Hillary on E-mails at the debate, hurting himself, and then she threw him under the bus (but failed). Disloyal person!

The last thing our country needs is another BUSH! Dumb as a rock!

. @JebBush has embarrassed himself & his family with his incompetent campaign for President. He should remain true to himself.

Weak & ineffective @JebBush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response. False advertising!

I have an idea for @JebBush whose campaign is a disaster. Try using your last name & don’t be ashamed of it!

. @MelindaDC Don’t misrepresent in order to make a point. I was always tough on ISIS--as you’ll find out after I get elected.

. @CharlesHurt Thanks for defending me so brilliantly against @MelindaDC -- Always tough when they falsify.

Will be on @jimmykimmel in 20 minutes on @ABC . #Kimmel #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

. @GlennBeck got fired like a dog by #Fox . The Blaze is failing and he wanted to have me on his show. I said no - because he is irrelevant.

Will be on @jimmykimmel tonight at 11:35pmE on @ABC . #Kimmel #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Hillary Clinton is weak and ineffective - no strength, no stamina.

Jeb Bush had a tough night at the debate. Now he'll probably take some of his special interest money, he is their puppet, and buy ad's.

Thank you for the nice words @ktmcfarland. The debate was interesting, and fun. Keep up the great work!

Will be interviewed on the @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:00 P.M. Will be talking about the debate, and more!

Bill O'Reilly calls Trump and campaign brilliant. In first place by 27 points.

. @MarkHalperin works so hard but just doesn't have a natural instinct for politics. Others do, and those are the people you want to follow!

Thank you @davidaxelrod for your nice words this morning on @CNN . It was a good night!

Thank you, so many people have given me credit for winning the debate last night. All polls agree. It was fun and interesting!

Thank you, @FrankLuntz - for saying I was a winner tonight. It is my great honor. #Trump2016

"@SPerkins50: @CNN @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Donald represents real Americans." Thank you!

Highly respected PUBLIC POLICY POLLING (PPP) just announced that I am number one in IOWA. Thank you!

. #JoeTheismann was great as a political analyst on @FoxNews . He knows far more than football. Thanks for the nice words Joe!

I won every debate so far according to all debate polls including @DRUDGE_REPORT , @TIME @Slate and more. Too bad dopey @megynkelly lies!

Between Iraq war monger @krauthammer , dummy @KarlRove , deadpan @GeorgezWill , highly overrated @megynkelly , among others, @FoxNews not fair!

I am in Trump International Hotel, Las Vegas, getting ready and waiting for the debate tonight. Look forward - hope I get treated fairly!

I wonder if @megynkelly and her flunkies have written their scripts yet about my debate performance tonight. No matter how well I do - bad!

. @megynkelly is very bad at math. She was totally unable to figure out the difference between me and Cruz in the new Monmouth Poll 41to14.

. @megynkelly , the most overrated anchor at @FoxNews , worked hard to explain away the new Monmouth poll 41 to 14 or 27 pt lead. She said 15!

Why isn't anyone using the @CNN Iowa Poll with me having a big lead. They only want to use the one negative poll (2nd place).Dishonest press

Isn't it amazing that @CNN paid a fortune for an Iowa Poll, which shows me in first place over Cruz by 13%, 33% to 20% - then doesn't use it

Wow, I just had two very good Iowa polls and a phenomenal just out National Poll from @ABC @washingtonpost - 38%. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

@oreillyfactor , horrible defense of me against highly overrated @krauthammer . I will bring more people into the party & easily beat Hillary!

Why doesn't @CNN use the #CNN Iowa poll? @andersoncooper @andydean2014

Thank you @CarlHigbie . Great work on @CNN . #Trump2016

Thank you @hardball_chris for your nice words. They are very much appreciated. I fully understand that you really get it.

Can't believe Major League Baseball just rejected @PeteRose_14 for the Hall of Fame. He's paid the price. So ridiculous - let him in!

. @scottienhughes - you were fantastic on CNN. Thank you for the nice words. See you at the #GOPDebate .

. @PatrickBuchanan was great on @TeamCavuto @FoxNews . Thank you Pat! #Tump2016

Another great accolade for @TrumpGolf . Highly respected Golf Odyssey- awarded @TrumpDoral Blue Monster with best redesign. Thank you!

Why doesn't @FoxNews quote the new Iowa @CNN Poll where I have a 33% to 20% lead over Ted Cruz and all others. Think about it!

People have got to stop working to be so politically correct and focus all of their energy on finding solutions to very complex problems!

I was disappointed that Ted Cruz would speak behind my back, get caught, and then deny it. Well, welcome to the wonderful world of politics!

I did interview with Chris Wallace of @FoxNews in order to be fair. He then puts on Rove, Lane and Will, three Trump bashers, to discuss.

Many think that the Championship Course at Turnberry, home of The Duel In The Sun, will be the worlds best after the renovation.

A very good NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll was just released wherein I went up from last month and am in the lead. Nice!

. @danawhite Great job last night - very exciting! You have come a long way from those difficult early days, I am proud of you.

People that have read it tell me that @KarlRove book is terrible (and boring). Save your money! @FoxNews should can him, no credibility!

Chris Wallace @fox at 10:00 A.M.

. @CNN @jaketapper at 9:00 A.M.

. @Peggynoonannyc An election between Hillary and myself will be the biggest voter turnout in U.S. history. Just like the debates 24 M vs 2M.

. @Peggynoonannyc Interesting article, but I will beat Hillary easily. People that have given up on the system will come out to vote for me!

Something must be done with dopey @KarlRove - he is pushing Republicans down the same old path of defeat. Don't fall for it, Karl is a loser

I will be interviewed on @jaketapper @CNN at 9:00 A.M. and Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace at 10:O0 A.M. CNN Iowa Poll -13 point lead!

New CNN Iowa poll --- Trump 33, Cruz 20. Everyone else way down! Don't trust Des Moines Register poll- biased towards Trump!

Getting the support of @DanaWhite of UFC means a lot. A total winner, who has done an amazing job. Just ordered his fight to watch tonight!

. @Franklin_Graham , so many people have tweeted about your amazing words to me, thank you! Heading to big crowd in South Carolina!

I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:00 A.M. So much to talk about!

. @loudobbsnews did a fantastic interview with syndicated columnist Michelle Malkin. Congrats to both!

Just got back from Iowa, great people!

. @MonicaCrowley you were great with @SeanHannity on @FoxNews tonight. Thank you for your kind words. We will keep Americans safe.

Dopey Prince @Alwaleed_Talal wants to control our U.S. politicians with daddy’s money. Can’t do it when I get elected. #Trump2016

Thank you @SeanHannity & @BoDiet! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Tom Ridge is a failed 'Bushy' & PA Governor. Him & his friend @KarlRove shouldn't be allowed to do their bias commentary- nobody listens!

Tom Ridge should be focused on trying to bring the party together rather than ripping it apart w/ your faulty thought process. I will win!

Never get good #'s from failing Des Moines Register/Bloomberg. I think something's going on w/them. Up 13 in IA according to respected CNN.

. @chucktodd is a nice guy , but just hopeless. He knows so little about politics and, in particular, winning! I fixed his rating problem.

. @Morning_Joe just went off the rails. I will beat Hillary easily - she does not want to run against me. I am tuning them out, waste of time

. @tedcruz should not make statements behind closed doors to his bosses, he should bring them out into the open - more fun that way!

Looks like @tedcruz is getting ready to attack. I am leading by so much he must. I hope so, he will fall like all others. Will be easy!

. @Morning_Joe is so off on Iowa, which I am leading big in new @CNN poll. I will win Iowa. Also, I beat Hillary easily!

Great evening last night in New Hampshire. Got the endorsement from the New England Police Union - big territory, great people! Thank you.

. @BernardGoldberg was not good tonight on @oreillyfactor . He just doesn't know about winning! But he is a nice guy.

Respected Morning Consult poll just out. I lead all Republicans and beat Hillary head to head by a wide margin- 45 to 40!

Thank you to @Franklin_Graham . I have always appreciated your courage, but now more so than ever!

Establishment flunky @KarlRove is going crazy with the just released CBS poll that has me way ahead. New Fox poll has me beating Hillary.

Dummy @KarlRove continues to make and write false statements. He still thinks Romney won--he should get a life!

The United Kingdom is trying hard to disguise their massive Muslim problem. Everybody is wise to what is happening, very sad! Be honest.

I have decided to postpone my trip to Israel and to schedule my meeting with @Netanyahu at a later date after I become President of the U.S.

Our VISA system is broken, like so much else in our country. We better get it fixed really fast. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends this morning at 7:30. So much to talk about!

Wow, my poll numbers have just been announced and have gone through the roof!

. @Megynkelly spent a big part of her show talking about other shows spending so much time on me. Really weird, she's being driven crazy!

Weak and totally conflicted people like @TheRickWilson shouldn't be allowed on television unless given an I.Q. test. Dumb as a rock! @CNN

Great interview tonight @donlemon - very professionally done. @CNN

Thank you @oreillyfactor for your wonderful editorial as to why I should have been @TIME Magazine's Person of the Year. You should run Time!

Why does @CNN bore their audience with people like @secupp , a totally biased loser who doesn't have a clue. I hear she will soon be gone!

. @secupp , who can't believe that her candidate has bombed so badly, is one of the dumber pundits on T.V. Hard to watch, zero talent! @CNN

. @donlemon on @CNN at 10:00 P.M.

I am interviewed on the @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:00. Then at 10:00, I am interviewed by @donlemon on @CNN . Enjoy!

. @Mayor_Nutter of Philadelphia, who is doing a terrible job, should be ashamed for using such a disgusting word in referring to me.Low life!

I told you @TIME Magazine would never pick me as person of the year despite being the big favorite They picked person who is ruining Germany

"@ray_aub: @nytimes @CNN People forget the policies of leaders like @JebBush allowed 9/11 killers to immigrate, drive, & pilot planes"

Hillary Clinton does not have the STRENGTH or STAMINA to be President. We need strong and super smart for our next leader - or trouble!

The last person corrupt Hillary Clinton wants to run against is Donald J. Trump. I'll end up beating her in every state. New Fox Poll-Trump!

The failing @nytimes does not mention the new @CNN Poll that has me leading Iowa by a massive 13 points - I am at 33%. Maggie Haberman, sad!

Great poll numbers just coming out of New Hampshire. BIG lead for "Trump" according to @CNN !

Wow, what a day. So many foolish people that refuse to acknowledge the tremendous danger and uncertainty of certain people coming into U.S.

Our country is facing a major threat from radical Islamic terrorism. We better get very smart, and very tough, FAST, before it is too late!

Despite my great respect for King Abdullah II, I will not be visiting Jordan at this time. This is in response to the false @AP report.

Prior to the end of the year, I will be traveling to Israel. I am very much looking forward to it.

Will be on @ABC News tonight at 6:30. Interviewed by the legendary @BarbaraJWalters ! Enjoy

The legendary @BarbaraJWalters will be asking me questions about the Presidential campaign on @WNTonight at 6:30 PM.

A very big poll is coming out at 6 PM in New Hampshire. Will be very interested in the results.

I wish the @WSJ Wall Street Journal had reported the just out @CNN Iowa Poll correctly. I lead by a wide margin,13 points, going up big!

Just won IOWA @CNN Poll BIG: Trump 33% Cruz 20% Rubio 11%, but @WSJ reported "Cruz momentum" but nothing about the fact that I easily won!

Just released @CNN Poll gives me a big 13 point lead in Iowa. Change your false story failing @nytimes . Thank you Iowa!

The main stream media wants to surrender constitutional rights -- I believe #ISIS needs to surrender!

Just put out a very important policy statement on the extraordinary influx of hatred & danger coming into our country. We must be vigilant!

I am especially grateful for the tremendous support I have received from the Evangelicals in the just out Iowa CNN poll. Thank you!

I am greatly honored by the results of the CNN poll in Iowa. In the end, I believe the final results will be even better than that!

. @washingtonpost is going out of its way to tell failing candidates how to beat Donald Trump.The Post doesn’t get that I’m good at winning!

" @BornToBeGOP @DanScavino Trump will only increase his lead after the terror attacks. America believes Trump will get rid of ISIS!"

If @amazon ever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash and it would crumble like a paper bag. The @washingtonpost scam is saving it!

The @washingtonpost loses money (a deduction) and gives owner @JeffBezos power to screw public on low taxation of @Amazon ! Big tax shelter

The @washingtonpost , which loses a fortune, is owned by @JeffBezos for purposes of keeping taxes down at his no profit company, @amazon .

N.Y.C. has the worst Mayor in the United States. I hate watching what is happening with the dirty streets, the homeless and crime! Disgrace

I spoke with other candidates to a Jewish group, many friends, in D.C. I said "I'm a negotiator like you" Got standing O-rated best of day!

Obama said in his speech that Muslims are our sports heroes. What sport is he talking about, and who? Is Obama profiling?

Thank you Graham Ledger of the Daily Ledger @OANN for your really fair coverage and your great interview with Peter Roff of U.S. NEWS & W.R.

Well, Obama refused to say (he just can't say it), that we are at WAR with RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS.

Should have gone after the oil years ago (like I have been saying).

Wish Obama would say ISIS, like almost everyone else, rather than ISIL.

Is that all there is? We need a new President - FAST!

Hope he won't spend too much time ripping apart the 2nd. Amendment!

The podium in the Oval Office looks odd! Not good, but the words will be the key.

Hillary won't call out radical Islam! She will be soundly defeated.

I will be re-tweeting some of your better, most imaginative and hopefully insightful tweets. Make them good (great)! Important stuff.

BIG NIGHT ON TWITTER TONIGHT. I WILL BE LIVE TWEETING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SPEECH AT 7:50 P.M. ( EASTERN). MUST TALK RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM!

Gee, @meetthepress with @chucktodd was getting terrible ratings then, with me, he set records - I saved his job, but Chuck still not nice!

Wow, @GeorgeWill said some very nice things about me today on @FoxNewsSunday with Chris Wallace. I am making progress, thanks George!

I will be live-tweeting President Obama's prime-time speech tonight starting at 7:50 P.M. (Eastern).Will he finally state the real problems?

. @BrookslawBrooks Thank you so much for your nice words. I will make you look very smart!

" @BrianBl43802294 @JohnKasich Trump is not controlled by donors,special interests,Lobbyists like U.Ur a total puppet.Trump is working 4 U.S.

So, how did I do on Face The Nation?

Watch Face The Nation - will be on now!

Hillary just said that she will not use the term "radical Islamic" - but was incapable of saying why. She is afraid of Obama & the e-mails!

I will be interviewed on Face The Nation @CBSNews at 10:30 A.M. Should be interesting - ENJOY!

Was going to do a phoner this morning with @jaketapper on @CNN but they could not get their phone equipment to hook in. Will do next week.

Wonder if Obama will ever say RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORIST?

. @KatyTurNBC & @DebSopan should be fired for dishonest reporting. Thank you @GatewayPundit for reporting the truth. #Trump2016

@Maddow , you copied incompetent @KatyTurNBC incorrect story. I'm sure you would like to apologize to me on show. Thank you for the courtesy.

Raleigh, North Carolina, was fantastic last night. Such incredible spirit. We all want to, and will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

. @JRubinBlogger one of the dumber bloggers @washingtonpost only writes purposely inaccurate pieces on me. She is in love with Marco Rubio?

The horrible shooting that took place in San Bernardino was an absolute act of terror that many people knew about. Why didn’t they report?

. @marthamaccallum Martha, great interview with my son @EricTrump -- smart, tough & professional. Thank you! @FoxNews

The virtually incompetent Republican Strategist who has had a failed career, Cheri Jacobus, is incoherent with anger that her puppets died!

. @CNN & @CNNPolitics Please thank Alisyn Camerota, David Chalian and John King for the very professional reporting of the new CNN Poll.

. @CNN Poll just came out, amazing numbers for those who want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! TRUMP 36%, a 20 point lead over 2nd place. Thanks.

. @MarkHalperin I totaly won the RJC meeting yesterday. Know many members who said "not even close." Only FULL standing O. But don't want $'s

Great to see the construction of the Old Post Office on Penn Ave. Going fast - under budget, ahead of schedule!

It was recently reported that 3rd rate $ losing @Politico is a foil for the Clintons. Questions given to Clinton in advance. No credibility.

Why can't @Politico get better reporters than Ben Schreckenger? Guy is a major lightweight with no credibility. So dishonest!

Loved being in Manassas, VA last night. Such incredible spirit! Now in DC for a speech, will then visit Old Post Office under construction.

As a presidential candidate, I have instructed my long-time doctor to issue, within two weeks, a full medical report-it will show perfection

I consider my health, stamina and strength one of my greatest assets.The world has watched me for many years and can so testify-great genes!

Congratulations on the GREAT job done by POLICE and law enforcement on the California shootings. Give credit where credit is due.

Heading to Manassas, Virginia, for a rally. Will have a moment of silence for the victims of the California shootings. So sad!

#TeamTrump . Police and law enforcement seem to have killed one of the California shooters and are in a shootout with the others. Go police

"@BOSSYtxmar55: #Trump WILL WIN! He's counting on ALL supporters TO VOTE Then "WE" CELEBRATE WITH TAILGATE STYLE PARTIES! #TeamTrump

"@TRUMPHIANT2016: This country is being frayed by the inept politicians in DC. We need to vote smarter and be more informed. #TeamTrump "

"@iceblink62: @realDonaldTrump Mr. Trump, the Establishment both sides are out to stop your presidency, and the American people!" True!

California shooting looks very bad. Good luck to law enforcement and God bless. This is when our police are so appreciated!

I beat Hillary in the new @FoxNews Poll head to head. SHE HAS NO STRENGTH OR STAMINA, both of which are needed to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I WILL BE ON @foxandfriends AT 7:30 -NOW!

Just arrived in New Hampshire. Another packed venue! Will be fun.

You would think a paper like the Washington Post would be fair and objective. For the record, almost all polls showed I won all debates.

Highly untalented Wash Post blogger, Jennifer Rubin, a real dummy, never writes fairly about me. Why does Wash Post have low IQ people?

Jamiel Shaw was incredible on @foxandfriends this morning. His son, who was viciously killed by an illegal immigrant, is so proud of pop!

I want to thank all my friends in Macon for the special evening and great reception. What a crowd of incredible people!

Meeting with African American Pastors at Trump Tower was amazing. Wonderful news conference followed. Now off to Georgia for big speech!

The Republican establishment, out of self preservation, is concerned w/ my high poll #'s. More concerned are Dems—I beat Hillary heads up!

How is Chris Christie running the state of NJ, which is deeply troubled, when he is spending all of his time in NH? New Jerseyans not happy!

Wow, the MSM is really going after me. 12,000 in Sarasota, a love fest, hardly a mention. Only one negativity - they only want negatives!

When will @CNN get some real political talent rather than political commentators like Errol Louis, who doesn't have a clue! Others bad also.

Great job @MariaTCardona on @ThisWeekABC . You made kooky Cokie Roberts and @BillKristol look even dumber than they are. You will be right!

After my meeting with the pastors, it's off to Georgia for a big rally - many thousands of great people will be there, a beautiful movement!

Will be meeting on Monday at Trump Tower with a large group of African American Pastors. Many I know-wonderful people! Not a press event.

Just watched Cookie Roberts on @ABC . Her predictions have been so wrong for so long that she has lost all credibility. Just another sad case

"@Allibiis: @realDonaldTrump @ArtPar17 @CNN story is bogus. Donald Trump has the most diverse group of voters/supporters in the GOP field."

. @CNN has to do better reporting if it wants to keep up with the crowd.So totally one-sided and biased against me that it is becoming boring

"@Pablo44x: @CNN @realDonaldTrump Another hit piece by CNN. "What? We're not biased!""

I will be on @meetthepress in an interview with @chucktodd on Sunday morning. So much to talk about!

The Sarasota, Florida, rally today was amazing. 12,000 people chanting their love for our country. It's going to happen, this is a MOVEMENT!

. @CNN Kayleigh McEnany was great on you network today. You should have her on more often! Thank you Kayleigh for your nice words.

"@buckleybro40: @RichLowry @maggieNYT @TheFix @pbump @realDonaldTrump so great in Sarasota, FL! #TurntTrump We're following T all the way!"

Virtually no-one has spent more money in helping the American people with disabilities than me. Will discuss today at my speech in Sarasota

The reporter who pulled-back from his 14 year old never retracted story is having fun. I don't know what he looks like and don't know him!

I will be going to Sarasota, Florida, today for a big rally with amazing people! I have one goal on mind: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

"@DeusVultGeorgia: @MingBlueTeaCup @RickCanton @_Holly_Renee @realDonaldTrump should the reporter's dishonesty be shielded from ridicule?"

"@VaughnVhalen: Donald Trump Rises to 38% Nationally; Ted Cruz Edges into 2nd at 12%

The failing @nytimes should focus on fair and balanced reporting rather than constant hit jobs on me. Yesterday 3 boring articles, today2!

I do not know the reporter for the @nytimes , or what he looks like. I was showing a person groveling to take back a statement made long ago!

Happy Thanksgiving to all. Have a great day and look forward to the future. We will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

The numbers at the @nytimes are so dismal, especially advertising revenue, that big help will be needed fast. A once great institution-SAD!

So, since the people at the @nytimes have made all bad decisions over the last decade, why do people care what they write. Incompetent!

The dopes at the @nytimes bought the Boston Globe for $1.3 billion and sold it for $1.00. Their great old headquarters-gave it away! So dumb

The @nytimes is so poorly run and managed that other family members are looking to take over control. With unfunded liabilities-big trouble!

The failing @nytimes should be focused on good reporting and the papers financial survival and not with constant hits on Donald Trump!

@KarlRove just totally bombed on @Morning_Joe . @FoxNews has him on even though he has lost all credibility - a loser! Fox should dump Rove.

"@raider8381: @Morning_Joe @FoxNews America wants DONALD TRUMP! "TV Heads" still refuse to embrace that reality! Media are LIARS."

South Carolina was so great last night. Will be back soon!

Why would @greta use @KarlRove as an election analyst when he has made so many mistakes. He still thinks Romney won. An establishment dope!

A wonderful evening in South Carolina - big crowd, amazing energy!

Thank you for your nice words @MikeNeedham @Heritage for the nice words on @FoxNewsSunday with Chris Wallace. #FNS #Trump2016

What is Frank VanderSloot getting for agreeing to back Marco Rubio? Last victim was Mitt Romney - see how that turned out.

"@Maryland4T: @SmallBiz4Trump Keep up the good work! Americans of ALL kinds are rallying behind jlDonaldTrump to help #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Will be doing @seanhannity at 10 PM on @FoxNews . As always with Sean, will be interesting!

Heading to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Really big crowd—so much to talk about!

Republicans must stop relying on losers like @KarlRove if they want to start winning presidential elections. Be tough and get smart!

Just left Columbus rally of 14,000 people --- a far bigger crowd than even I expected! Unbelievable evening, incredible spirit in the arena!

Heading for Ohio - really big crowd of amazing people! Much to talk about!

Going to Ohio, home of one of the worst presidential candidates in history--Kasich. Can't debate, loves #ObamaCare --dummy!

. @WSJ reports that @GOP getting ready to treat me unfairly—big spending planned against me. That wasn’t the deal!

When you do your Christmas shopping remember how disloyal @Macys was to the subject of illegal immigration. #BoycottMacys #DumpMacys

Going to Columbus, Ohio today for a tremendous rally of thousands. The silent majority is no longer silent!

. @AP has one of the worst reporters in the business -- @JeffHorwitz wouldn’t know the truth if it hit him in the face.

. @AP continues to do extremely dishonest reporting. Always looking for a hit to bring them back into relevancy—ain’t working!

. @MatthewJDowd thank you for the nice comments recently, especially on @BarbaraJWalters . My family & I greatly appreciate your kind words.

Hillary Clinton is weak on illegal immigration, among many other things. She is strong on corruption - corruption is what she's best at!

"@drewtheg: Trump is the epitome of integrity, good spirit, forthright honesty... you pull no punches and call a spade a spade. diggin it!"

We better get tough with RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS, and get tough now, or the life and safety of our wonderful country will be in jeopardy!

13 Syrian refugees were caught trying to get into the U.S. through the Southern Border. How many made it? WE NEED THE WALL!

Great poll numbers all over and beating Hillary Clinton one on one. Thank you!

Big new @ABC Poll to be announced at 9:00 A.M. on This Week with @GStephanopoulos . I will be interviewed on show!

. @GStephanopoulos just announced that I am leading BIG in the new @ABC Poll which will be shown on This Week at 9:00 A.M. I will be on show

Will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:00 A.M.

I find that @Reuters is a far more professional operation than @AP .

.ccolvinj @AP is one of the truly bad reporters---working for an organization that has totally lost its way. Stories are fictional garbage.

. @heytana , great job - we are all proud of you!

It's too bad so few people showed up to @bobvanderplaats Family Leader dinner. Next year I'll try & be there- and they'll have a huge crowd!

Thank you John Nolte for wonderful analysis & reporting.

Rumor has it - Pataki, Kasich, & Senator Lindsey Graham are dropping out of the race very soon. Hope it's not true, they're so easy to beat!

A woman who got fired after two days of working with Scott Walker - a wacko - now trying to raise funds to fight me.

Heading to Birmingham, Alabama, and a massive crowd of incredible people! 12 noon - will be wild.

To show you how politicians act, Bobby Jindal spent $1,000 to register in New Hampshire & dropped out the next day. Such a waste!

We're stuck with the worst mayor in the United States. Too bad, but New York City will survive!

People are really liking my new book, "Crippled America." Check it out!

"@Greg39529063: @ABC2020 @ABC @BarbaraJWalters Watching now! Great! Always true to his word and the USA! A real leader! So nice to hear!!!"

Looking forward to watching the legendary @BarbaraJWalters interview my family (and me) tonight on @ABC at 10:00. Many things to talk about!

. @washingtonpost @BretBaier Please thank Charles Lane for his new found confidence. He has made a very good bet!

. @Gracematters Thank you, a very wise bet! Best wishes.

Just got back from South Carolina. Going to Alabama tomorrow!

. @HillaryClinton is weak on illegal immigration & totally incompetent as a manager and leader - no strength or stamina to be #POTUS !

. @BilldeBlasio should focus on running #NYC & all of the problems that he has caused with his ineptitude, & not be so focused on me!

Can you believe the worst Mayor in the U.S., & probably the worst Mayor in the history of #NYC , @BilldeBlasio , just called me a blow hard!

I didn't suggest a database-a reporter did. We must defeat Islamic terrorism & have surveillance, including a watch list, to protect America

. @mkhammer , a Fox contributor, isn't smart enough to know what is going on at the border. @TheJuanWilliams made the point far better!

Going to South Carolina now, great place, SRO crowd. Iowa was amazing yesterday!

The media must denigrate ISIS at all levels or youth will continue to be drawn to it. These are low level degenerates, NOT masterminds!

The media must immediately stop calling ISIS leaders "MASTERMINDS." Call them instead thugs and losers. Young people must not go into ISIS!

A wonderful afternoon in Iowa! Great people! Heading now to Florida - tomorrow, South Carolina! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016

John Kasich was managing director of Lehman Brothers when it crashed, bringing down the world and ruining people's lives. A total failure!

Once John Kasich announced he was running for president, and opened his mouth, people realized he was a complete & total dud!

John Kasich fell right into President Obama’s trap on ObamaCare, and the people of Ohio are suffering for it. Shame!

Doesn’t help Kasich to do negative ads on me because he still has to go through everyone else - he’s almost last.

John Kasich ad guy wanted to work for me, but his proposal was a rip off – I said NO! Now ripping Kasich.

I loved beating John Kasich in the debates, but it was easy—he came in dead last!

Kasich has already spent $6 million on ads in New Hampshire and his numbers have gone down. People from NH are smart!

Watch Kasich squirm --- if he is not truthful in his negative ads I will sue him just for fun!

I want to do negative ads on John Kasich, but he is so irrelevant to the race that I don’t want to waste my money.

John Kasich, despite being Governor of Ohio, is losing to me in the Ohio polls. Pathetic!

John Kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image, not negative ads on me.

Governor Kasich, whose failed campaign & debating skills have brought him way down in the polls, is going to spend $2.5 million against me.

The legendary Barbara Walters interviews Melania Trump and me on a special this Friday night at 10:00 on ABC. Don't miss it!

The POLICE in Paris did a fantastic job. Very brave - not easy!

Everyone is now saying how right I was with illegal immigration & the wall. After Paris, they’re all on the bandwagon.

I skipped a speech given years ago at Mar-a-Lago by dopey @GeorgeWill because he’s BORING—he never forgot!

Dopey @GeorgeWill , a big proponent of the Iraq War and other catastrophes, doesn’t like me very much. That means I win!

Broken down political pundit @GeorgeWill , who is wrong almost all of the time, should be thrown off @FoxNews . Boring and totally biased!

Eight Syrians were just caught on the southern border trying to get into the U.S. ISIS maybe? I told you so. WE NEED A BIG & BEAUTIFUL WALL!

Ben Carson is being severely criticized for being incapable of understanding foreign policy be one of his top consultants. Not good!

" @FoxNews New Hampshire Poll: @realDonaldTrump 'Rules GOP Race in New Hampshire.' Trump 27, Rubio 13, Cruz 11, Bush 9, Carson 9, & Kasich 7"

I will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight at 10:00 on @FoxNews . Much, much, much to talk about!

Melania and I just had interview with the legendary @BarbaraJWalters . Watch #abc2020 this Friday. Tonight we talk ISIS @WNTonight

. @AP is doing very badly. I can say from experience their reporting is terrible & highly inaccurate. Sadly, they are now irrelevant!

One of the saddest things in journalism is what happened to the formerly great @AP . They have lost their way and are no longer credible.

Refugees from Syria are now pouring into our great country. Who knows who they are - some could be ISIS. Is our president insane?

I, along with almost everyone else, have so little confidence in President Obama. He has a horrible attitude-a man who is resigned to defeat

So many great polls like Reuters - big leads everywhere. New Hampshire really special! We will win big and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Just received a copy of @SarahPalinUSA new book -- a great read! Sarah is a terrific person.

Just landing in Knoxville, Tennessee! Massive crowd expected! Will all have a great time, despite serious subject matter.

Will be landing in Knoxville, Tennessee shortly - tremendous crowd expected. It's all very simple, we want to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain !

Republicans must stop listening to dopes like @KarlRove who still insists Mitt Romney won the last election. Think big & think strong!

Wow, @Macys shares are down more than 40% this year. I never knew my ties & shirts not being sold there would have such a big impact!

Remember, I was the one who said attack the oil (ISIS source of wealth) a long time ago. Everyone scoffed, now they're attacking the oil.

Tom Brady just did it again. He is not only a great guy, he is, without question, the BEST quarterback!

President Obama just told President Putin how important the Russian air strikes against ISIS have been. I TOLD YOU SO!

. @JohnLegere @TMobile John, focus on running your company, I think the service is terrible! Try hiring some good managers.

Glad to see that @RondaRousey lost her championship fight last night. Was soundly beaten - not a nice person!

I have watched sloppy Graydon Carter fail and close Spy Magazine and now am watching him fail at @VanityFair Magazine. He is a total loser!

. @VanityFair Magazine is doing really poorly. It has gotten worse and worse over the years, and has lost almost all of it's former allure!

We need strong, tough and brilliant leadership now more than ever! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I had a great time in Texas yesterday. A tremendous crowd of wonderful and enthusiastic people. Will be back soon!

When will President Obama issue the words RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM? He can't say it, and unless he will, the problem will not be solved!

I think everyone will like my new and very successful book, Crippled America. Go get it and let me know what you think!

Wow, Bernie Sanders just admitted that the real unemployment rate is 10% (it is actually over 20%) and for African American youth - 51%.

Hillary and Sanders are not doing well, but what is the failed former Mayor of Baltimore doing on that stage? O'Malley is a clown.

Why won't President Obama use the term Islamic Terrorism? Isn't it now, after all of this time and so much death, about time!

We need much tougher, much smarter leadership - and we need it NOW!

President Obama said "ISIL continues to shrink" in an interview just hours before the horrible attack in Paris. He is just so bad! CHANGE.

My prayers are with the victims and hostages in the horrible Paris attacks. May God be with you all.

Boy is this guy @ShepNewsTeam tough on me. So totally biased. As a reporter, he should be ashamed of himself! #Trump2016

They laughed at me when I said to bomb the ISIS controlled oil fields. Now they are not laughing and doing what I said. #Trump2016

Thank you @JakeTapper for giving me credit for my vision on bombing the oil fields. Should have been done long ago. #Trump2016

. @seanhannity Carly, whose campaign is dead, is making false statements about me in order to salvage hope! Sad.

. @CarlyFiorina had to inject herself into my factual statements concerning Ben Carson in order to breathe life into her failing campaign!

. @CarlyFiorina I only said I was on @60Minutes four weeks ago with Putin—never said I was in Green Room. Separate pieces—great ratings!

. @CarlyFiorina Ben Carson said in his own book that he has a pathological temper & pathological disease. I didn’t say it, he did. Apology?

. @CarlyFiorina Carly—I did graduate from Wharton and did very well. Who is your fact checker? Will you apologize?

. @CarlyFiorina Carly, not just you, I also told Gov. Kasich to “let Jeb talk, give him a chance” because Kasich was constantly cutting in.

First candidate in Virginia with over 16,000 validated signatures for the ballot. An honor - thank you! #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

I will be on @OutFrontCNN with @ErinBurnett at 7PM. Tune in! #Trump2016

I will be on with @BretBaier tonight at 6PM. #Trump2016

From 2% to 27% in Texas - quite a jump into first place!

Wow, pres. candidate Ben Carson, who is very weak on illegal Immigration, just said he likes amnesty and a pathway to citizenship.

Why does the failing @WSJ write a false editorial about me and let dummy @KarlRove make the same mistake in the same edition of the paper?

. @KarlRove is a biased dope who wrote falsely about me re China and TPP. This moron wasted $430 million on political campaigns and lost 100%

We, as a country, either have borders or we don't. IF WE DON'T HAVE BORDERS, WE DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY!

Why wouldn't the @WSJ call for comment or clarification before writing an editorial which is so totally wrong. No wonder it is doing poorly!

When and how are the dummies at the @WSJ going to apologize to me for their totally incorrect Editorial on me. I want "smart" trade deals.

The @WSJ Editorial Board is so wrong, so often. They got info from an incorrect story in another pub. Why not watch and listen to debate.

. @WSJ Editorial Board should review my debate statement re China and T.P.P. and apologize. China not part but will get their way in later.

Today's @WSJ Editorial is WRONG again. I know that China is not in the new T.P.P. trade deal but would come in latter through a back door.

I will be interviewed on @MariaBartiromo @FoxBusiness at 7:30

All seven on-line polls, including Drudge and Time, with thousands of respondents, said I won the debate. @krauthammer said I was "so, so."

Will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight at 8 PM.

I will be on @marklevinshow at 8PM tonight. Tune in!

. @gerardtbaker Gerard—wonderful job last night as moderator of the debate. I told many, “really smart and elegant.”

I never said that China was in the bad TPP trade deal but that China would come in the back door at a later date. @CNN @FoxBusiness

Just returned home from the great state of New Hampshire. Have made so many friends there--special place!

Happy Veterans Day. To those who have served, thank you for your special work.

Loved doing the debate...won Drudge and all on-line polls! Amazing evening, moderators did an outstanding job.

Will be on @Morning_Joe live from New Hampshire - 7:00 A.M. Talking about the debate and more!

"@Rmac747: Keep up the good work, Donald! Hello from Vancouver where the new & amazing Trump Tower and Hotel almost complete!

I will be on @Morning_Joe live from New Hampshire tomorrow at 7am. #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Go out and buy CRIPPLED AMERICA: How to Make America Great Again. Doing really well. Great Thanksgiving or Christmas present!

"@ray_aub: Funny all the real polls have @realDonaldTrump way ahead.

I will be interviewed by @GStephanopoulos on @GMA at 7:00 A.M. There is much to talk about!

Marco Rubio is totally weak on illegal immigration & in favor of easy amnesty. A lightweight choker - bad for #USA !

Marco Rubio couldn't even respond properly to President Obama's State of the Union Speech without pouring sweat & chugging water. He choked!

Marco Rubio is a total lightweight who I wouldn’t hire to run one of my smaller companies - a highly overrated politician!

Great job on @Greta @DonaldJTrumpJr . Nobody could have done it better!

Thank you to all of those who gave me such wonderful reviews for my performance on @nbcsnl Saturday Night Live. Best ratings in 4 years!

"@EmitteLucemTuam: @realDonaldTrump @EricShawnonFox Great job Donald! Good luck from Canada!"

. @EricShawnonFox Highest rated Saturday Night Live in four years. 47% higher than their opening night with Hillary & Miley Cyrus. Nice words

Television ratings for @nbcsnl Saturday Night Live just came out and they were great - the best since 2011. Very few protesters!

At 10:30 I will be interviewed on both @meetthepress by @chucktodd and @CBSNews Face The Nation by John Dickerson. This after long evening!

I will be interviewed by @GStephanopoulos on @ABC at 10:00 A.M.

. @CNN Will be interviewed by Jake Tapper at 9:00 A.M. Enjoy.

. @nbcsnl - So much fun last night!

Will be on @foxandfriends at 8:00 A.M.

Amazing evening at Saturday Night Live!

I am at the Saturday Night Live Studio - electricity all over the place. We will be doing a "tweeting" skit, so stay tuned!

"@jak00seven: If you like how @HillaryClinton handled #Benghazi , then you'll just her as Commander-in-Chief #MakeAmericaGreatAgain "

They are saying that tickets to tonight's Saturday Night Live are the hardest to get in the history of this great show! Off to a good start!

Saturday Night Live has some incredible things in store tonight. The great thing about playing myself is that it will be authentic! Enjoy

. @RobertGBeckel Please thank your brother for his nice words on television. Seems like a great guy and character! @CNN

One of the dumbest political pundits on television is Chris Stirewalt of @FoxNews . Wrong facts - check Fox debate rankings, Trump #1. Dope!

Would be nice if @jmartNYT learned how to read the polls before writing his next story. Probably done on purpose, but not good reporting!

@BillKristol has become a sad case. His magazine is failing badly, probably doesn't have long to go, and his predictions are always wrong!

So sad that Obama rejected Keystone Pipeline. Thousands of jobs, good for the environment, no downside!

Happy Birthday to the great @BillyGraham . He's done so many wonderful things, not the least of which is his fantastic family. I love Billy!

.@AJDelgado13 Thank you so much for the nice words and support--really enjoy listening to your ideas and thoughts.

I think it would be a good idea—and fair—to include @GovChristie & @MikeHuckabeeGOP in the debate. Both solid & good guys. @FoxBusiness

Carson now admits his friend named "Bob," who he tried to stab (Bob was saved by his belt buckle!), no longer exists as Bob. Wrong name!

With Ben Carson wanting to hit his mother on head with a hammer, stab a friend and Pyramids built for grain storage - don't people get it?

Such bad reporting: A puff piece on Ben Carson in the @nytimes states that Carson "is trying to solidify his lead." But I am #1, easily! Sad

Florida Ethics Commission Advocate comes down hard on Rubio. So do two people who worked with him. Said he used the wrong credit card! Sure.

"@rhinostate: . @realDonaldTrump @GrundleMan27 Rubio is a Manchurian Candidate. People will own him if he ever became president."

"@DeeMcNa: @FoxNews Silent majority did not try to kill their mothers, like Ben Carson, but wants America rebuilt by only one capable:TRUMP"

A great honor to easily finish FIRST in the @FoxNews poll tabulation even though some of my best polls were not used in determining winner!

The Carson story is either a total fabrication or, if true, even worse-trying to hit mother over the head with a hammer or stabbing friend!

"@TeamSpringsteen: @realDonaldTrump I just finished reading Crippled America. It's a detailed blueprint to get America back on track."

. @seanhannity should have corrected Jeb Bush when he said that I "ran for president twice." Never ran, merely considered running!

Jeb Bush just said about Marco Rubio, "he's my friend!" Pure political speak. Why can't he be truthful and say "disloyal guy, no friend!"

Also, tune in to the @TodayShow at 7:00am. I will be on to discuss the campaign, my new ads and #CrippledAmerica .

I will unveil my first campaign ads on @Morning_Joe at 6:30am tomorrow. Enjoy! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Wow! @FoxNews poll just came out. #1 with 26%! Almost as importantly, I am the strongest on economic issues by far! #Trump2016

Just landed in New Hampshire - a very exciting morning planned!

Isn't it terrible that @megynkelly used a poll not used before (I.B.D.) when I was down, but refuses to use it now when I am up?

I will be on @SeanHannity tonight at 10pmE talking about my new book #CrippledAmerica and much more! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016

. @CharlesGKoch is looking for a new puppet after Governor Walker and Jeb Bush cratered. He now likes Rubio--next fail.

Join me today, Nov 3rd, in #TrumpTowerNYC at noon. I'll be signing copies of my new book CRIPPLED AMERICA. Don't miss it!

I will be interviewed on @GMA at 7:00 A.M. and @foxandfriends at 7:50. Talking about my new book, out today, Crippled America.

Join me tomorrow, Nov. 3rd, at 12pm in #TrumpTowerNY . I’ll be signing copies of my new book CRIPPLED AMERICA. Don’t miss it!

. @CharlesMBlow Why don’t you use new polls instead of the single ancient national poll that was a tiny bit negative. Dishonest reporting!

Thank you Carl Higbie (former Navy Seal) for you support of my plan to straighten out the Veterans Administration-a mess!Great job @kilmeade

"@taurus82409: @Morning_Joe DONALD TRUMP is the absolute WINNER!! You "heads" try to talk around him, WHY, WHY??? Go TRUMP!"

. @Morning_Joe : Marco only won the debate in the minds of desperate people. I won every on-line poll, even crazy @CNBC . Marco good looking?

Sirius National News at 7:30 A.M. Steve Bannon. @BreitbartNews

Now that Iran ripped us off by making one of the best deals of any kind in history, they have just moved to block any imports from the U.S.

I will be on Sirius XM RADIO, National News Show, at 7:30 A.M. (Monday) hosted by the great Steve Bannon. @BreitbartNews

Thank you @JoeTrippi for the nice, and true, words on #Media Buzz with terrific Howie Kurtz. Leading New Hampshire 30 to 12. @FoxNews

While in politics it is often smart to send out false messages, one thing is clear: That Hillary does not want to run against TRUMP.

Join me Tuesday Nov. 3rd at 12 PM in #TrumpTower in NYC. I'll be signing copies of my book CRIPPLED AMERICA. Don't miss it!

If Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate. BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered!

Marco Rubio will not win. Weak on illegal immigration, strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a "lightweight".

I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other. Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor!

Jeb's new slogan - "Jeb can fix it". I never thought of Jeb as a crook! Stupid message, the word "fix" is not a good one to use in politics!

Further proof that Gang of Eight member Marco Rubio is weak on illegal immigration is Paul Singer's, Mr. Amnesty, endorsement.Rubs can't win

"@BellicWolf: @and_is_w Anyway, for me the most original costume was Donald Trump like President!!!!"

Gov. John Kasich has really failed on the campaign trail. I thought he would have been far more talented. He is just wasting time & money!

. @thehill John Oliver had his people call to ask me to be on his very boring and low rated show. I said "NO THANKS" Waste of time & energy!

Few people know that @FortuneMagazine is still in business. Tell your writer Alisa Soloman that I left The Apprentice to run for president

No complaints but how many people would be watching these really dumb but record setting debates if I wasn't in them? Interesting question!

Thank you James Freeman of the @WSJ for the very nice words. All polls said I won the debate except NBC (3rd). Explain to Daniel Henninger!

Support Coach Kennedy and his right, together with his young players, to pray on the football field. Liberty Institute just suspended him!

. @ColinCowherd said such nice things about me during the debate that I thought I'd do his show, @TheHerd , on Monday (2:30pm EST).

The @WSJ Wall Street Journal loves to write badly about me. They better be careful or I will unleash big time on them. Look forward to it!

Lifting off right now for U.S.S. Wisconsin in Norfolk. See ya'

I told you so- @politico just lost it's top person. Poor results and no money to pay him. If they were legit, they would be doing far better!

I am leaving for Norfolk, Virginia - the great battleship U.S.S. Wisconsin - for a big rally and really big crowd. See you soon!

I see Marco Rubio just landed another billionaire to give big money to his Superpac, which are total scams. Marco must address him as "SIR"!

The new NBC POLL has me in first place but said I was third in the debate - I demand a recount (just kidding!). EVERY other poll had me #1.

Black Lives Matter protesters totally disrupt Hillary Clinton event. She looked lost. This is not what we need with ISIS, CHINA, RUSSIA etc.

I am going to save Medicare and Medicaid, Carson wants to abolish, and failing candidate Gov. John Kasich doesn't have a clue - weak!

When candidate John Kasich, on the @oreillyfactor , talked about dismantling Medicare and Medicaid, he was referring to Ben Carson.

. @GovMikeHuckabee Great job on @FoxNews tonight. Thanks for your nice words about my children. Class!

Super PACs should be disavowed by anyone running for President. They are a total scam on our system and country! I am self-funding.

Thank you @rushlimbaugh for your wonderful words. We will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Happy Birthday to my wonderful daughter, @IvankaTrump .

Thank you @Morning_Joe for explaining to @CNN and @andersoncooper and so many others that I am leading in almost all national & state polls.

Thank you @CharlesHurt for the nice words on @seanhannity . I will win and Make America Great Again!

Loved doing the debate last night on @CNBC . Check out all of the polls! Everyone agrees that Harwood bombed!

Wow, just heard really bad stuff about the failing @politico . How much longer will they be around? Some very untalented reporters.

My interview on @ThisWeekABC with @GStephanopoulos had a 40%+ ratings increase over same Sunday last year. 20% over last week.

Join me Tuesday, Nov. 3rd at 12pm in Trump Tower NYC. I’ll be signing copies of my new book CRIPPLED AMERICA. Don’t miss it!

. @SpeakerRyan Congratulations and good luck - you will do a GREAT job for our wonderful U.S.A.!

Failing host @glennbeck , a mental basketcase, loves SUPERPACS - in other words, he wants your politicians totally controlled by lobbyists!

"@agentvf: @realDonaldTrump Stay strong and get ready for next debate. Great job last night."

Thank you to everybody for your wonderful comments on my debate performance - it was a lot of fun! Today I will be speaking in Reno, Nevada.

"@jakistheman: @realDonaldTrump keep you're momentum until you win over the White House"

Thank you @morningmika and @JoeNBC for all of your nice words and comments on the debate!

The money losing @politico is considered by many in the world of politics to be the dumbest and most slanted of the political sites. Losers!

Thanks, @PiersMorgan . You're great!

Thanks everyone, they all said I won the debate. Even won the @CNBC Poll!

"@jaxsiete: @realDonaldTrump Love your sense of humor...LOL Your rallies are amazing. We're standing behind you 1000%:)" @FoxNews

@CNBC POLL TOTAL: TRUMP 25.22 CARSON 19.78 RUBIO 9.67....

. @TheEconomist Poll, one of the most highly respected, was just released. Wow, wait until the media digests these numbers - won't be happy!

"@cmrose111: @realDonaldTrump @CNBC get your polls straight. Trump is going to win. He is the only one tough enough to run this country."

Does anybody think that @CNBC will get their fictitious polling numbers corrected sometime prior to the start of the debate. Sad!

. @Morning_Joe can you believe Kasie Hunt's poor and purposely inaccurate reporting on my great night and crowd in Iowa. @politico is a scam!

. @CNBC continues to report fictious poll numbers. Number one, based on every statistic, is Trump (by a wide margin). They just can't say it!

After a great evening and packed auditorium in Iowa, I am now in Colorado looking forward to what I am sure will be a very unfair debate!

" @RickSt . How many MSM outlets will carry a clip of @realDonaldTrump leaving the podium to enter a crowd & listen to the concerns of a VET?

"@fairy_tabibi: Loved seeing @realDonaldTrump speak to the wounded warrior & his family.He has a caring heart and will take care of our vets

I am leaving for Sioux City, Iowa - great event (rally).

New Gravis national poll just out --- 36%! Very nice! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

"@TheJusticeEngle: @realDonaldTrump I'm 18 years old from Florida, and just registered to vote. You got my vote in the primaries!" THANKS.

Dopey @BillKristol , who has lost all credibility with so many dumb statements and picks, said last week on @Morning_Joe that Biden was in.

All Presidential candidates should immediately disavow their Super PAC’s. They're not only breaking the spirit of the law but the law itself

Re Super PAC scam: What the other candidates are doing is a disgrace.

This whole Super PAC scam is very unfair to a person like me who has disavowed all PAC's & is self-funding.

Ben Carson wants to abolish Medicare - I want to save it and Social Security.

Leaving for New Hampshire now. Will be doing the @TODAYshow there, live at 7:00 A.M. New @CBSNews Poll of New Hampshire: Trump 38 Carson 12!

Remember that Carson, Bush and Rubio are VERY weak on illegal immigration. They will do NOTHING to stop it. Our country will be overrun!

Do you think I will get credit for keeping Ford in U.S. Who cares, my supporters know the truth. Think what can be done as president!

Word is that Ford Motor, because of my constant badgering at packed events, is going to cancel their deal to go to Mexico and stay in U.S.

"@Thuglife602: @realDonaldTrump Bad position for Jeb, if his Mommy, Daddy and brother get involved the skeletons come back out of the closet

. @ByronYork Great numbers from @CBSNews Poll. Also from ABC-Washington Post Poll. Thank you! @CNN

Do you believe that @FoxNews is still playing up the old Iowa poll numbers and no mention of the ABCWashington Post or just out CBS results?

. @CBSNews Poll - WOW! New Hampshire TRUMP 38% CARSON 12% BUSH 8% South Carolina TRUMP 40% CARSON 23% CRUZ 8% Iowa TRUMP 27% CARSON 27%

Watch my interview on @CBSNews Face The Nation now and, also, the new CBS POLLS which, if good for me, the media won't report!

"@MachadoKirk: @StrengthenTheUS @realDonaldTrump Carson is not a nice guy. He knows his SuperPAC throws Mud on Trump 24/7 #ActingMeek "

Big poll comes out today on Face The Nation at 10:30 on @CBSNews .

Watch @CNN at 9:00 A.M. @jaketapper . Then interviewed on @ABC @GStephanopoulos at 10:00 A.M. and then, at 10:30 A.M., watch Face The Nation.

Ben Carson has never created a job in his life (well, maybe a nurse). I have created tens of thousands of jobs, it's what I do.

I spell out some of the differences between Ben Carson and myself at 9:00 A.M. on @CNN @jaketapper . Ben is very weak on illegal immigration.

A big POLL will be announced this morning on @CBSNews Face The Nation. I wonder if I do well if the press will report the results? Doubt it

This is just not the right time for Jeb Bush. His campaign is in total disarray, too much staff being paid way too much money = U.S. GOVT.

I will be doing a major sit down interview on State of the Union With Jake Tapper at 9:00 A.M. on @CNN . Enjoy!

While Jeb Bush is cutting staff and salaries, after having paid ridiculous amounts of money, why did he pay so much in the first place?

. @JebBush is slashing campaign salaries, people making millions. If he can't manage his campaign, how can he manage our countries finances?

. @JebBush is totally lost -- he spends too much time managing the bloated staff of his campaign & not enough talking about America's future.

Expecting a great crowd of amazing people. Questions will be live! #TrumpToday

I will be doing the @TodayShow live from New Hampshire at 7am on Monday morning. #TrumpToday

Will be doing a sit down interview with @JakeTapper @CNN on Sunday morning at 9:00. Tough questions and hopefully very good answers!

Just finished speaking in Jacksonville, Florida. Incredible crowd, fantastic people. Thank you!

Leaving for Jacksonville now. See you there! Miami was great.

Massive crowds already forming in Jacksonville - will be and incredible day - 12 noon! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Crowd was amazing tonight at Trump National Doral in Miami. Love and excitement in the ballroom. Tomorrow at noon in Jacksonville!

"@Ir0nSpirit: Can't wait for you to take the White House. Our country will once again be strong! Sorry JebBush, but you got no chance!"

" @dpdax @realDonaldTrump Thanks for standing for Vets Take care of those that give so much"

The young intern who accidentally did a Retweet apologizes.

" @toddinwichita @realDonaldTrump Hillary is doing a HORRIBLE job at #BenghaziHearings reading from the script. #pathetic . She is no leader"

" @i_am__tyler @MichaelCohen212 I can promise you the only reason I watched the democrat's debate is because of @realDonaldTrump "

I think Joe Biden made correct decision for him & his family. Personally, I would rather run against Hillary because her record is so bad.

New poll by ABC News/Washington Post TRUMP 32 CARSON 22 RUBIO 10 BUSH 7 Wow, how will the media put a negative spin on this one?

I will be interviewed on @GMA Good Morning America at 7:00 A.M. @ABC will be announcing new poll numbers. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Just out: Boston Herald/Franklin Pierce Poll N.H. TRUMP 28 (up 10) CARSON 16 BUSH 9 RUBIO 6 CRUZ 5 Press will say they are surging!

I will be interviewed on @GMA Good Morning America tomorrow at 7:00 A.M. Big new ABC poll coming out - I hope I do well!

"@AshlieJuliard: @KarlRove @realDonaldTrump Trump is the only candidate that I've ever been excited about #SomethingSpecialIsHappening "

. @seanhannity at 10:00.

. @KarlRove Had my best day ever in the polls, one had me at 41% - Morning Consult. Boston Globe, Monmouth, NBC and CNN all great. More!

I will be interviewed on @seanhannity tonight at 10:00. You will find it very interesting (I hope). Enjoy!

Both Aberdeen and Turnberry in Scotland, and the soon to open Doonbeg in Ireland, blow Bandon Dunes away. Bandon is a toy by comparison!

I will be on @seanhannity tonight at 10 PM @FoxNews . #Hannity

Jeb is fighting to defend a catastrophic event. I am fighting to make sure it doesn't happen again.Jeb is too soft-we need tougher & sharper

It's really cold outside, they are calling it a major freeze, weeks ahead of normal. Man, we could use a big fat dose of global warming!

"@Weaverinc31: The problem is @MittRomney was a weak establishment candidate who couldn't even turn out the base. Weak at best!"

Best thing my supporters can do if you don't like the way @megynkelly and her puppets unfairly treat "us" is don't watch her show!

"@traceclmbs82: @FoxNews Pampered @GeorgeWill who never had a real job has no problem w/USA losin jobs 2 foreign countries @FoxNewsSunday "

"@howddyd: @FoxNewsSunday @realDonaldTrump is correct u can't allow 1 woman 2 fain luv of house 2 get more $$$ holding up huge #'s of jobs."

Fox News Sunday With Chris Wallace will be re-broadcast on @FoxNews at 6:00 P.M.

Just reported by CNN that "the Trump halo effect" caused a record-shattering Democratic Debate rating of 15.3 million viewers. So true!

It's amazing that some of the dumbest people on television work for the Wall Street Journal, in particular a real dope named Charles Lane!

I will be interviewed by Chris Wallace at 2:00 P.M. on @FoxNews - Turn off the football for 15 minutes, Make America Great Again!

Replay of Fox News Sunday With Chris Wallace at 2:00 P.M. on @FoxNews . Big statement made by Chris!

I should release the sad and totally apologetic letter that Penn @pennjillette hand delivered to me. Minds would be changed very fast!

"@smr111382: @realDonaldTrump One of the best interviews I have seen!" @FoxNews

Does everyone remember @MittRomney and his famous remarks about "self-deportation" and "47%". He was done. I don't need his angry advice!

. @MittRomney and his campaign manager should not be critical of candidates after they blew an election that should never have been lost!

. @MittRomney can only speak negatively about my presidential chances because I have been openly hard on his terrible "choke" loss to Obama!

. @FoxNewsSunday

Jeb, why did your brother attack and destabalize the Middle East by attacking Iraq when there were no weapons of mass destruction? Bad info?

This morning Chris Wallace has the best political show on television - but that's only because I'm on it (kidding)! Have fun.

Jeb Bush should stop trying to defend his brother and focus on his own shortcomings and how to fix them. Also, Rubio is hitting him hard!

On at 9:00A.M. or 10:00 A.M. (depending on your location) on Fox is a tough but really good interview with Chris Wallace. Enjoy!

Good news for those that want to Make America Great Again - I am winning every poll in every STATE and NATIONAL - and by big numbers! Thanks

I will be interviewed on Fox News Sunday With Chris Wallace at 9:00 A.M. or 10:00 A.M. (depending on location). Will be tough but good!

. @HillaryClinton is on the front page of the @nytimes waving to 200 people in New Hampshire. My crowd next door was 5,000 people – no pic!

. @KatrinaPierson , you did a fantastic job tonight on @FoxNews . Thank you for your very tough and very smart representation!

. @JebBush , like it or not, our country needs more energy and spirit than you can provide! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

No @JebBush , you’re pathetic for saying nothing happened during your brother’s term when the World Trade Center was attacked and came down.

. @JebBush , At the debate you said your brother kept us safe- I wanted to be nice & did not mention the WTC came down during his watch, 9/11.

In Massachusetts --- the place is packed! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Rumor has it that the grubby head of failing @VanityFair Magazine, "Sloppy" Graydon Carter, is going to be fired or replaced very soon?

. @scottienhughes Keep up the great work Scottie. Polls are best ever!

. @EricTrump was FANTASTIC on @foxandfriends this morning. He may be my son but he is a special guy!

. @CNBC has just agreed that the debate will be TWO HOURS. Fantastic news for all, especially the millions of people who will be watching!

Every poll, Time, Drudge, Slate and others, said I won both debates - but heard Megyn Kelly had her two puppets say bad stuff. I don't watch

. @marcthiessen is a failed Bush speechwriter whose work was so bad that he has never been able to make a comeback. A third rate talent!

Megyn Kelly has two really dumb puppets, Chris Stirewalt & Marc Threaten (a Bushy) who do exactly what she says. All polls say I won debates

Will be on @bloombergtv tomorrow with @sruhle . Enjoy!

Why is the @GOP being asked to do a debate that is so much longer than the just-aired and very boring #DemDebate ?

. @CNBC is pushing the @GOP around by asking for extra time (and no criteria) in order to sell more commercials.

The @GOP should not agree to the ridiculous debate terms that @CNBC is asking unless there is a major benefit to the party.

. @KevinHart4real joined @woodmank104 @katek104 @K1047 & was asked about his thoughts on @realDonaldTrump #Trump2016 Thanks Kevin--so nice!

"@FoxGotTrumped: @realDonaldTrump with another great speech today with another huge crowd!!!!! We love you Trump!!!! #Trump2016

Just did @OReillyFactor . Will be back on at 11pm on @FoxNews .

"@CHM1321: @realDonaldTrump is "in it to win it"."

. @andersoncooper did an excellent job of hosting the #DemDebate last night. Tough, firm, but fair.

Steven Tyler got more publicity on his song request than he’s gotten in ten years. Good for him!

Even though I have the legal right to use Steven Tyler’s song, he asked me not to. Have better one to take its place!

Will be going to Richmond, Virginia today. Big crowd! See you there.

The debate last night proved that Hillary is running against the “B” team. She won’t be so lucky when it comes to me!

#DemDebate was really boring but had a lot of fun live tweeting and picked up by far the most followers.

Like her or not, Hillary did what she had to do in the debate last night—get through it. Her opponents were very gentle and soft!

Check out OAN and compare to what you are watching now!

Wow, I am giving a speech on OAN. Much more exciting than debate!

Notice that illegal immigrants will be given ObamaCare and free college tuition but nothing has been mentioned about our VETERANS #DemDebate

Sanders said only black lives matter - wow! Hillary did not answer question!

"@julieruot: I want a president who believes all lives matter and that is why we need @realDonaldTrump ."

Sorry, there is no STAR on the stage tonight!

Good move by Bernie S.

The hardest thing Clinton has to do is defend her bad decision making including Iraq vote, e-mails etc.

All are very scripted and rehearsed, two (at least) should not be on the stage.

Who is winning the debate so far (just last name)? #DemDebate

O'Malley, as former Mayor of Baltimore, has very little chance.

Can anyone imagine Chafee as president? No way.

"@amd9890: . @realDonaldTrump was right... #DemDebate is boring these ppl are so scripted" So far!

The trade deal is a disaster, she was always for it! #DemDebate

Get rid of all of these commercials. #DemDebate

Putin is not feeling too nervous or scared. #DemDebate

"@JoethomasSmith: #DemDebate The @IvankaTrump interview tomorrow on @CNN will have better ratings than the #democraticdebate #Trump2016

We will all have fun and hopefully learn something tonight. I will shoot straight and call it as I see it, both the good and the bad. Enjoy!

Should be interesting but too bad the three guys at《1% will be taking up so much time - but who knows, maybe a star will be born (unlikely)

"@ElviNichols: Will @CNN be tough as they were with @realDonaldTrump ? No way, they will want to be soooo nice!

" @seancduarte @TeamCavuto #Yourworld If @realDonaldTrump wins Barry Diller will move out of country. Sounds like a win, win."

How can Jeb Bush expect to deal with China, Russia + Iran if he gets caught doing a “plant” during my speech yesterday in NH?

Everybody's talking about my doing twitter during the likely very boring debate tonight. @realDonaldTrump #DemDebate

" @Ma1973sk I can't wait for @realDonaldTrump live tweets during Dem debate tonight. Won't watch debate but will watch Trump's Twitter"

The arrogant young woman who questioned me in such a nasty fashion at No Labels yesterday was a Jeb staffer! HOW CAN HE BEAT RUSSIA & CHINA?

Sheldon Adelson is looking to give big dollars to Rubio because he feels he can mold him into his perfect little puppet. I agree!

Someone should inform @CNN that, despite spending millions of $'s on graphics, it is not the Democratic Debate, rather the Democrat (s) D!

At the request of many, and even though I expect it to be a very boring two hours, I will be covering the Democrat Debate live on twitter!

Will be interviewed by @SeanHannity on @foxnews at 10PM tonight. Enjoy!

" @CFT1 @realDonaldTrump doing a great job in New Hampshire today ! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain "

Leaving soon after a great time in New Hampshire, a truly special place!

Great, everyone is saying I did much better on @60Minutes last week than President Obama did tonight. I agree!

President Obama was terrible on @60Minutes tonight. He said CLIMATE CHANGE is the most important thing, not all of the current disasters!

I will be on Face The Nation (CBS) today at 10:30 A.M. and Media Buzz (Fox News) at 11:00 A.M. Enjoy!

Just got back from Georgia. The crowds and love for U.S. was so amazing! We all had a great day together - will be back soon!

Little Barry Diller, who lost a fortune on Newsweek and Daily Beast, only writes badly about me. He is a sad and pathetic figure. Lives lie!

With the fantastic ratings last weekend, @meetthepress & @ThisWeekABC , I think it’s only fair that I go on @FoxNewsSunday w/ Chris Wallace.

Will be interviewed on @FaceTheNation with @JDickerson tomorrow at 10:30am EST. Enjoy!

My interview with @HowardKurtz on #MediaBuzz will air tomorrow on @Fox at 11am and 5pm. Great job Howie, very insightful.

. @ThisWeekABC with @GStephanopoulos had fantastic numbers last Sunday --- Trump interview. Nice!

. @ChuckTodd just informed us that my interview last week on @MeetthePress was their highest rated show in 4 years. Congrats!

I'm leading big in every poll and we are going to WIN! Remember, Trump NEVER gives up!

Paul Ryan is far from my first choice, but a very nice guy. The Republicans should go for tough and (very) smart this time - no games!

"@bdean1468: @realDonaldTrump ATL LOVES TRUMP!!!" Thanks!

Heading for Atlanta tomorrow morning for noon speech at North Atlanta Trade Center. Big crowds, great people!

Will be interviewed on "Media Buzz" with Howie Kurtz on Fox, Sunday at 11:00 A.M.

Great Gravis Poll on the great state of NH. Also, watch @FaceTheNation on CBS & @HowardKurtz #mediabuzz -- both on Sunday.

" @paulfincher2 Keep the faith. Elect @realDonaldTrump and there will be no more sanctuary cities. and very few illegals."

Will be interviewed on @Morning_Joe at 7:20. Great crowd in Las Vegas yesterday!

I was so happy when I heard that @Politico , one of the most dishonest political outlets, is losing a fortune. Pure scum!

. @EWErickson ran @RedState into the ground. A change was necessary. Congratulations to @RedState and good luck in the future!

. @EWErickson is a total low life--- read his past tweets. A dummy with no “it” factor. Will fade fast.

" @Momfullofhope @BorderWall @realDonaldTrump rocks it everywhere he goes" Thanks.

" @DesignerDeb3 Wow 5000+ in Line in Las Vegas For our Next President of these United States Mr @realDonaldTrump !"

Washington (D.C.) is such a mess - nothing works! I will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! It's not going to happen with anyone else.

Great, Kevin McCarthy drops out of SPEAKER race. We need a really smart and really tough person to take over this very important job!

I'm at Trump Int'l Hotel in Las Vegas, tallest/most beautiful building in town. Speaking to another great crowd at Treasure Island (12 noon)

What a time we all had in Iowa yesterday, massive overflow crowd. Love them!

Wow, great news! I hear @EWErickson of Red State was fired like a dog. If you read his tweets, you'll understand why. Just doesn't have IT!

I hear @glennbeck is in big trouble. Unlike me, his viewers & ratings are way down & he has become irrelevant—glad I didn’t do his show.

Wacky @glennbeck who always seems to be crying (worse than Boehner) speaks badly of me only because I refuse to do his show--a real nut job!

"@PjwJ316: @realDonaldTrump YES!!!!!!!!!! AMERICA NEEDS @realDonaldTrump FOR PRESIDENT!!! CAN'T WAIT FOR AMERICA TO BE GREAT AGAIN!!!!"

Just arrived in Las Vegas for a packed house speech tomorrow. Big poll results today, Leading big everywhere. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Iowa was amazing today. Great crowd, great people. Thanks, will be back soon!

. @stuartpstevens made some of the dumbest political decisions of all time in helping Romney to get destroyed by Obama. Should have won!

Just found out I won the Rockingham County Republican Booth Straw Poll at the Deerfield Fair in New Hampshire this past weekend. 39% ---Wow!

. @politico has no power, but so dishonest!

I wonder why somebody doesn't do something about the clowns @politico and their totally dishonest reporting.

Heading to a packed house in Waterloo, Iowa! Will celebrate today's great poll numbers together. See you soon!

If Stuart Stevens' book is as bad as his horrible political advice to Mitt Romney, don't waste your money. Arrogant guy but a zero!

Ben Carson was speaking in general terms as to what he would do if confronted with a gunman, and was not criticizing the victims. Not fair!

Crooked @club4growth has given up advertising in Iowa on me—remember they wanted my million dollars—I said no—total frauds!

. @WayneNewtonMrLV Wayne, such a pleasant surprise--so nice. Thank you very much.

"@SteveBrainard1: @realDonaldTrump @CNN great interview Trump!"

"@CPO_Mark_2010: @realDonaldTrump is fired up on @cnn !!! So are your supporters!! #Trump2016 "

I will be interviewed on @CNN New Day at 7:03 A.M. Enjoy!

Don't ever forget, we will, together, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

So, so, so important - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Political strategist Stuart Stevens,who led Romney down the tubes in what should have been an easy victory,has terrible political instincts!

Thoughts and prayers for those in the floods affecting the great people of South Carolina.

The incompetence of our current administration is beyond comprehension. TPP is a terrible deal.

For all of my fantastic supporters, and for the U.S.A., we are going to win and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, maybe greater than ever before!

I'm leading by big margins in every poll but the press keeps asking, would you ever get out? They are just troublemakers, I'm going to win!

"@DGrant39107133: @nathanpaul1975 Clinton may go to jail but is still running for president? 99% of people would be in jail for what she did

I will be on @MeetThePress with @ChuckTodd tomorrow morning at 10:30am ET on @NBC . Enjoy!

Rubio was very disloyal to Bush, his mentor, when he decided to run against him. Both said they "love" each other.They don't - word is hate!

Bush and Rubio are finally attacking each other, as I knew they would, in order to be the last "establishment" man standing against me.Great

Thank you @megynkelly for the nice things you said about Melania. You will like her, great heart and smart - always wanting to help people!

Congratulations to my brother Robert & Ann Marie on the success of @MontesKitchen in Dutchess County, New York (Amenia.) Great food!

Will be in Nashville, Tennessee, tomorrow (Saturday) at 2:30 P.M. So much to talk about - see you there!

I was so looking forward to being in Virginia Beach, Virginia, today. The demand for tickets was amazing. Good luck with storm, back soon!

"@VoteDonaIdTrump: @realDonaldTrump @Renhowe @donlemon @CNN we love trump"

My warmest condolences to the families of the horrible Roseburg, Oregon, shootings.

I will be interviewed on @seanhannity tonight at 10:00. Many things, mostly bad, to talk about!

. @MittRomney is trying to hit back at me because I'm saying that he let the Repub Party down w/ his loss to Obama. Should've won—he choked!

Just got back from New Hampshire. Great crowd, great people! Will be back soon!

"@sternbutgreg: @realDonaldTrump is pulling away from the pack. I live in Iowa. It's real." Thank you!

I will be interviewed by @donlemon tonight on @CNN at 10PM.

Rubio is totally owned by the lobbyists and special interests. A lightweight senator with the worst voting record in Senate. Lazy!

Just read that "Trump" has the largest (and I add most enthusiastic) crowds. Tonight I will be in New Hampshire - the place will be packed!

I watched lightweight Senator Marco Rubio, who is all talk and no action, defend his WEAK position on illegal immigration. Pathetic!

Carl Icahn said this about me: "I think at this moment in time, he’s the only candidate that speaks out about the country’s problems."

I hope when Rand Paul gets out of the race—he is at 1%--his supporters come over to me. I will do a much better job for them.

Prediction: Rand Paul has been driven out of the race by my statements about him-- he will announce soon. 1%!

Do you believe this - Iran wants to trade our 3 prisoners (not 4) for 19 prisoners held by the U.S. Should have been let go with last deal!

Wow, the ratings for @60Minutes last night were their biggest in a year--- very nice!

Will be doing @OutFrontCNN with @ErinBurnett tonight at 7 pm re: tax reductions and various other topics.

" @SpurrellJulie First time in my life I wish I was an American citizen so I could vote for @realDonaldTrump !!"

Looking forward to press conference on taxes at 11AM at @TrumpTowerNY .

"@midwestcaucus: @60Minutes Great interview,Trump ruled. Great response 2 Trade War claim. All anyone has 2 do is look at foreign tariffs

" @MeOnAJourney @realDonaldTrump Imagine that, an American president standing up for the American people! Go Trump Go! #Trump2016 "

Hope we all enjoy @60Minutes tomorrow night. I do believe they will treat me fairly!

Marco Rubio is a member of the Gang Of Eight or, very weak on stopping illegal immigration. Only changed when poll numbers crashed.

"@taurus82409: @CBS @60Minutes Look forward to it, Donald. You are doing Great! Please keep up the fight, many of us are behind you 100%!!

Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio is VERY weak on immigration, knows nothing about finance and would be incapable of making great trade deals!

Just left Oklahoma--- the most amazing crowd and people! What a night!

I will be on @cbs @60minutes this Sunday. A great honor-- hope you enjoy it.

. @MarcoRubio is weak on illegal immigration and will allow anyone into the country Has worst attendance record in Senate- rarely there to vote on a bill! @marcorubio 

Dishonest @politico just called to say that none of the polls including Fox, NBC, CNN, Zogby, & Morning Consult matter. Serious haters.

I am now inspecting the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue - will be a great hotel. Soon off to the Oklahoma State Fair!

Great reception in D.C. At the Values Voter Summit. Now checking on my job at the Old Post Office Ahead of schedule and under budget! Will be in Oklahoma tonight! 

. @megynkelly , the @FoxNews poll said very plainly I came in second in the debate. All others, Time, Drudge, Slate etc. said I came in 1st.

Just watched @marcorubio on television. Just another all talk, no action, politician. Truly doesn't have a clue! Worst voting record in Sen.

The failing @politico news outlet, which I hear is losing lots of money, is really dishonest!

. @politico , which is not read or respected by many, may be the most dishonest of the media outlets--- and that is saying something.

Despite the establishment and the media’s best efforts, the people are speaking loudly and clearly. Thank you to my amazing supporters!

So happy about my daughter @IvankaTrump ’s announcement that she will be having a baby this spring. Congratulations!

Will be on @Morning_Joe at 6:30 A.M.

Will be on @CNN at 7:00 A.M.

. @FoxNews owes me an apology for allowing clueless pundit @RichLowry to use such foul language on TV. Unheard of!

Incompetent @RichLowry lost it tonight on @FoxNews . He should not be allowed on TV and the FCC should fine him!

. @FoxNews has been treating me very unfairly & I have therefore decided that I won't be doing any more Fox shows for the foreseeable future.

Headline reads" Rubio passes Bush in Florida poll" -- Unfair, because Trump destroys them both! Trump 31.5%, Rubio 19.2%, Bush 11.3%

. @JuliInkster Congratulations on your great win--what a captain, what a champion!

I will be the featured guest on the season opener of @60Minutes this Sunday. There certainly is plenty to talk about!

Just remember, the birther movement was started by Hillary Clinton in 2008. She was all in!

I think @megynkelly should take another eleven day "unscheduled" vacation.

Do you ever notice that lightweight @megynkelly constantly goes after me but when I hit back it is totally sexist. She is highly overrated!

Senator Marco "amnesty" Rubio, who has worst voting record in Senate, just hit me on national security-but I said don't go into Iraq. VISION

Yom Kippur blessings to all of my friends in Israel and around the world. #YomKippur

2016 Republican Primary Morning Consult Poll was just released. TRUMP 32, CARSON 12, BUSH 11, FIORINA 6, RUBIO 5, CRUZ 5. Taken after debate

. @RichLowry is truly one of the dumbest of the talking heads - he doesn't have a clue!

I am having a really hard time watching @FoxNews .

"@blewthebigone: @realDonaldTrump Can't even think what the race would be without you in it."

. @oreillyfactor , why don't you have some knowledgeable talking heads on your show for a change instead of the same old Trump haters. Boring!

. @oreillyfactor was very negative to me in refusing to to post the great polls that came out today including NBC. @FoxNews not good for me!

I will be interviewed tonight at 7pm ET by @greta #OnTheRecord

I got to know @ScottWalker well—he’s a very nice person and has a great future.

" @JudgeMoroz Zogby is respected in the business of polling ~ the media is attempting to silence the message @realDonaldTrump "

#AskTrump Send me your questions to answer live from @TwitterNYC later this afternoon.

"@talsept58: @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends You are great!!"

The @TODAYshow refused to use their just in poll numbers where I have a massive lead but instead used @CNN numbers where my lead is smaller.

Will be on @foxandfriends now. Enjoy!

"@SaijoSaijo75: @realDonaldTrump thank you for your personal and financial sacrifices to make america great again!"

Carly Fiorina did such a horrible job at Lucent and HP, virtually destroying both companies, that she never got another CEO job offer! Pres.

We are going to WIN and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, maybe better than ever before!

I am attracting the biggest crowds, by far, and the best poll numbers, also by far. Much of the media is totally dishonest. So sad!

I have been leading big in all polls, with two more today, @nbc and @CNN . The NBC poll is more than double next, at 29%. Fiorina has 11%.

There is no way that Carly Fiorina can become the Republican Nominee or win against the Dems. Boxer killed her for Senate in California!

I will be on @meetthepress at 10:30. @nbc will be releasing their new poll numbers. Based on the debate results, I should do well-who knows?

On my way to Iowa. Will be landing in Des Moines in two hours. See ya!

Christians need support in our country (and around the world), their religious liberty is at stake! Obama has been horrible, I will be great

If I would have challenged the man, the media would have accused me of interfering with that man's right of free speech. A no win situation!

If someone made a nasty or controversial statement about me to the president, do you really think he would come to my rescue? No chance!

This is the first time in my life that I have caused controversy by NOT saying something.

Am I morally obligated to defend the president every time somebody says something bad or controversial about him? I don't think so!

GIVE AMERICA BACK ITS DREAM! -- Donald J. Trump

Would be really bad if columnist Mike Lupica left the @NYDailyNews . A wonderful and talented guy!

Will be interviewed tonight by @seanhannity on @FoxNews at 10 PM. Enjoy!

Going to New Hampshire in a little while. Big crowds! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain !

Every poll done on debate last night, from Drudge to Newsmax to Time Magazine, had me winning in a landslide. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain !

Just announced that in the history of @CNN , last night’s debate was its highest rated ever. Will they send me flowers & a thank you note?

Thank you to Tom Brady, Coach Ditka, Coach Bobby Knight and all of the many champions that have been so supportive!

Will be heading over to the debate soon. Can you believe @CNN is "milking" it for almost 3 hours? Too long, too many people on stage!

"@almy23841665: @DlSCORD @realDonaldTrump More Veterans will vote for Trump than you can believe! I can't imagine they wouldn't!

I hope Arnold S. does well with the Apprentice because he is a nice guy and also, because I get a big percentage of the profits!

Just finished the wonderful event on the U.S.S. Iowa. VETERANS FOR A STRONG AMERICA endorsed me. Such a great honor, thank you!

. @rushlimbaugh Rush, I am in LA inspecting property (big job creator) & listening to you. You are truly fantastic--thanks!

The polls are really looking good—#1 everywhere despite all lobbyist & special interest $ being spent against me. I’m turning down millions.

Everyone is talking about the incredible event we had in Dallas last night. Spectacular crowd & arena! Thank you @mcuban .

. @club4growth asked me for $1 million. I said no. Now falsely advertising that I will raise taxes. I’ll lower big league for middle class.

My plan will lower taxes for our country, not raise them. Phony @club4growth says I will raise taxes—just another lie.

Little respected Club For Growth asked me for $1,000,000 - I said "NO". Now they are spending lobbyist and special interest money on ads!

Am now in L.A. Will be going to the U.S.S. IOWA at 5:30 P.M. to speak to our great VETERANS and other friends!

Our vets are treated like 3rd class citizens. Enough! Join me & @V4SA on @USSIOWA at LA Waterfront to hear my plan for vets & the military!

Loved Dallas and the tremendous crowd last night. Will be back!

Speech in Dallas went really well. Big and wonderful crowd. Just arrived in L.A. Big day tomorrow!

My opponents big bosses--lobbyists and donors--are trying to do damage. They will fail! Money down the drain!

To all my fans, sorry I couldn’t do The Apprentice any longer—but equal time (presidential run) prohibits me from doing so. Love!

Congrats to my friend @Schwarzenegger who is doing next season’s Celebrity Apprentice. He'll be great & will raise lots of $ for charity.

" @Doctr__Wang @CNN Nice! I love how Trump has a way of putting people on the spot. I wonder what CNN will do. The Veterans appreciate it!"

Why is someone like George Pataki, who did a terrible job as Governor of N.Y. and registers ZERO in the polls, allowed on the debate stage?

"@BigBrotherKat: I hated to love it, but @realDonaldTrump was hilarious on @jimmyfallon last night! @nbc #thedonald "

I am having a great time in Iowa at Jack Trice Stadium! Unbelievable people.

Too many people on stage for debate. @RandPaul at 11th, with 2% in @RealClearNews , shouldn't be allowed to participate.

I truly understood the appeal of Ron Paul, but his son, @RandPaul , didn't get the right gene.

Lightweight Senator @RandPaul should focus on trying to get elected in Kentucky--- a great state which is embarrassed by him.

. @mercedesschlapp thank you so much for your kind words on television -- fantastic job and greatly appreciated!

Will be on @foxandfriends at 8:00. Enjoy!

"@ColinCavall: You were a great sport on the show and I have total confidence in you rebuilding this country and making America great again.

"@JohnnnnyT: @realDonaldTrump blew it away on @FallonTonight . The ratings will be HUUUGE."

"@5SOS_jrt1d: Mr. Trump, you weren't just HUGE on @FallonTonight - you were AWESOME. WISDOM and HUMOR ARE A POWERFUL COMBINATION!!!"

The Tonight Show @nbc will be amazing - 11:30 P.M. ENJOY!

. @GovernorPerry is a terrific guy and I wish him well- I know he will have a great future!

On @FallonTonight with @jimmyfallon at 11:30 PM. Enjoy!

. @robertjeffress I greatly appreciate your kind words last night on @FoxNews . Have great love for the evangelicals -- great respect for you.

Just purchased NBC’s half of The Miss Universe Organization and settled all lawsuits against them. Now own 100% -- stay tuned!

Let’s all take a moment to remember all of the heroes from a very tragic day that we cannot let happen again!

Oh wow, lightweight Governor @BobbyJindal , who is registered at less than 1 percent in the polls, just mocked my hair. So original!

Also, tomorrow night I will be going to Boone and Ames. Really look forward to seeing all of my friends in Iowa.

Very good news—the new Quinnipiac poll just came out—I am #1 in Iowa.

I will be on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon tonight at 11:30. Should be fun! @jimmyfallon

Bobby Jindal did not make the debate stage and therefore I have never met him  I only respond to people that register more than 1% in the polls. I never thought he had a chance and I’ve been proven right. 

" @Plruble58 @realDonaldTrump The numbers are amazing! #GoGoGo "

I'll be on @greta ON THE RECORD tonight at 7 PM

Wow, I am ahead of the field with Evangelicals (am so proud of this) and virtually every other group, and Ben Carson just took a swipe at me

I had a great day in D.C. even though the subject was an unpleasant one, the horrible Iran Nuke deal. Amazing crowd and enthusiasm!

Man did JEB throw his brother under the bus last night on @colbertlateshow . Probably true, but not nice!

See you in D.C. tomorrow at 1:00 P.M. at the Capitol to protest the horribly negotiated deal with Iran. Really sad!

Will be on Bill O'Reilly @oreillyfactor tonight at 8 PM. Enjoy!

I'm on Bill @oreillyfactor tonight at 8 PM. It will be another lively interview about how to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain !

Jeb’s policies in Florida helped lead to its almost total collapse. Right after he left he went to work for Lehman Brothers—wow!

The lobbyists & special interests have just put out an ad for Jeb which hits me "just a little" but is very false!

I’m self funding my campaign but lobbyists & special interests for Jeb & others are starting to do big ads—desperate! Don’t believe them.

Thank you @IngrahamAngle for your strength & wonderful words last night on @FoxNews , but @KarlRove is easy to beat!

Tomorrow in DC: 1 PM West Front Lawn of the Capitol. Not even believable that we would do this deal with Iran.

Look forward to being in DC tomorrow—big crowd expected for our protest against the truly stupid nuclear deal we are making with Iran.

Looking forward to being with @SenTedCruz at our big rally in D.C. on Wednesday (1:00 P.M. at the Capitol) to protest insane Iran nuke deal!

Both Washington D.C. and DALLAS are turning out to be really big events. D.C. is protest of incompetent Iran deal and Dallas is big speech!

Remember, I'll see you in D.C. at the Capitol Building on Wednesday at 1:00 o'clock. Then Dallas on Sept.14 at 6:00 P.M. American Air Center

"@MJosephSheppard: No other GOP candidate has potential to win Ohio & Pennsylvania-thus the presidency, except "jobs" pres @realDonaldTrump !

Thank you @scottienhughes for your powerful words on @FoxNews . I am with the Evangelicals and Tea Party big time. We will all WIN together!

"@MJosephSheppard: No other GOP candidate has potential to win Ohio & Pennsylvania-thus the presidency except "jobs" @realDonaldTrump .

"@broewads: @realDonaldTrump @club4growth They are all just phony cronies. Keep up the Real Deal Mr. TRUMP YOU ARE THE MAN."

"@1ns1de_J9b: @realDonaldTrump @club4growth Borderline extortion scam. They would have used your $1M to extract "donations" from others"

"@SlwStdySqueeze: @realDonaldTrump is gonna do some great things! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 "

. @club4growth should release the letter they sent me asking for $1,000,000. When I said no, they came out against me. A scam operation?

I will be in Washington D.C. on Wednesday,1 P.M.,in front of the Capitol, to protest the horrible and incompetent deal being made with Iran.

The Dallas event on September 14 at 6:00 P.M. at the American Airlines Center looks like it will be a giant success. Tickets are going FAST!

Our country needs a president with great leadership skills and vision, not someone like Hillary or Barack, neither of which has a clue!

The phony Club For Growth, which asked me in writing for $1,000,000 (I said no), is now wanting to do negative ads on me. Total hypocrites!

"@HardcoreRepub: @realDonaldTrump AMERICA will be working again. BUSINESSMAN > POLITICIAN. Private sector growth above all. #Trump2016 "

The hedge fund guys (gals) have to pay higher taxes ASAP. They are paying practically nothing. We must reduce taxes for the middle class!

By self-funding my campaign, I am not controlled by my donors, special interests or lobbyists. I am only working for the people of the U.S.!

Remember that I am self-funding my campaign. Hillary, Jeb and the rest are spending special interest and lobbyist money.100% CONTROLLED

Hillary said such nasty things about me, read directly off her teleprompter...but there was no emotion, no truth. Just can't read speeches!

Hillary Clinton made a speech today using the biggest teleprompter I have ever seen. In fact, it wasn't even see through glass, it was black

Saudi Arabia was "vehemently" against the Iran nuclear deal. Then today they embraced it. What happened? What did we give them to endorse?

Wow, the Dallas event in two weeks looks like a big winner! Get your tickets (American Airlines Center) FAST!

Just announced that because of "Trump", advertising rates for debate on @CNN are going from $5000 to $200,000, a 4000% increase.PAY CHARITY?

Why would a very low ratings radio talk show host like Hugh Hewitt be doing the next debate on @CNN . He is just a 3rd rate "gotcha" guy!

Very low ratings radio host Hugh Hewitt asked me about Suleiman, Abu Bake al-Baghdad, Hassan Nasrallah and more - typical "gotcha" questions

The Dallas event in two weeks, at the American Airlines Center, is filling up fast. Get your tickets fast, before it is too late!

. @MeghanMcCain was terrible on @TheFive yesterday. Angry and obnoxious, she will never make it on T.V. @FoxNews can do so much better!

Will be on @Morning_Joe in 5 minutes - at 7:00. Enjoy!

Congratulations to Tom Brady on yet another great victory- Tom is my friend and a total winner!

The deal with Iran will go down as one of the most incompetent ever made. The U.S. lost on virtually every point. We just don't win anymore!

. @brithume , I am in first place by a lot in all polls, tied for first place with Ben Carson in one Iowa poll. I thought you knew this-thanks

. @kevinolearytv Great job on @foxandfriends this morning. You tell it like it is! Also, thx for the nice mention. Your book sounds great!

Will be interviewed on @GMA this morning at 7:00. Thanks for the GREAT poll results!

When I intelligently turned down The Club For Growth crazy request for $1,000,000, they got nasty.What a waste of money that would have been

The president of the pathetic Club For Growth came to my office in N.Y.C. and asked for a ridiculous $1,000,000 contribution. I said no way!

Every Poll has me winning BIG.If you listen to dopey Karl Rove, a Trump hater, on @oreillyfactor , you would think I'm doing poorly. @FoxNews

Why does @oreillyfactor and @FoxNews always have Karl Rove on. He spent $430 million and lost ALL races. A dope who said Romney won election

I’m turning down millions of dollars of campaign contributions—feel totally stupid doing so, but hope it is appreciated by the voters.

Many Super Pacs, funded by groups that want total control over their candidate, are being formed to “attack” Trump. Remember when u see them

Congrats everyone--we topped 4 million today on Twitter--and heading up fast!

While millions are being spent against me in attack ads, they are paid for by the “bosses” and “owners” of candidates. I am self funding.

Jeb is spending millions of dollars on “hit” ads funded by lobbyists & special interests. Bad system.

Yet another weak hit by a candidate with a failing campaign. Will Jeb sink as low in the polls as the others who have gone after me?

The just released Public Policy Polling (PPP - national result) is the best yet. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Just out - new PPP NATIONAL POLL has me in first place by a wide margin at 29%. I wonder why only @FoxNews has not reported this? Too bad!

150 Clinton E-mails still contain classified information. More sensitive when she was Sec.of State. This is a very big deal.

President Obama wants to change the name of Mt. McKinley to Denali after more than 100 years. Great insult to Ohio. I will change back!

For those that don’t think a wall (fence) works, why don’t they suggest taking down the fence around the White House? Foolish people!

Huma Abedin, the top aide to Hillary Clinton and the wife of perv sleazebag Anthony Wiener, was a major security risk as a collector of info

Leading in the Bloomberg Iowa poll. Also, my favorability numbers went up at a record, almost unheard of, clip. Thank you Iowa!

Loved being with my many friends in Tennessee. The crowd and enthusiasm was fantastic. I won the straw poll big!

Wow, Jeb Bush just lost three of his top fundraisers - they quit!

Leaving now for Tennessee. Big crowd!

Great rally last night in Massachusetts. 2000 people at a house - must be a record! Unbelievable spirit to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.

Will be interviewed by @SarahPalinUSA tonight at 10:00 on OAN Network. Enjoy!

"@jp_sitles: @realDonaldTrump HillaryClinton: she compared republicans to terrorist but will not call terrorists , terrorists. #OhMe "

Great job tonight on @FoxNews Tony. I am with you all the way! Make America Great Again @tperkins

"@therealbigdt: @FoxNews @krauthammer @realDonaldTrump #Trump is the Real Deal, Baby." Thank you.

"@RealEstateMOKS: @realDonaldTrump Build the wall! Everywhere I go, immigrants have our jobs! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #voteDonaldTrump "

Will be interviewed on @Morning_Joe at 7:00 A.M. So much to talk about!

The crowd in South Carolina was amazing. We set records and had a great time. Will be back soon.

Who wants the endorsement of a guy ( @EricCantor ) who lost in perhaps the greatest upset in the history of Congress?

. @BenFergusonShow just watched you on @CNN . Thank you for your nice comments.

Great job on @CNN tonight @heytana . We are all proud of you! Also, congrats on a great son - he is going places.

. @KatrinaCampins You were absolutely great on @CNN ! Thank you.

. @DennisDMZ Thanks for the nice words. You are fantastic!

Will be interviewed on the @TODAYshow this morning at 7:00. Talking about politics, polls and whatever. Enjoy!

Just got back from Iowa. Fantastic evening with truly fabulous people. Will be back again soon. Thanks!

Heading to Iowa to a packed house. Just released polls, all first place, are amazing. Thank you!

Thank you @BillKristol . I am going to Make America Great Again!

" @ladycatherinecd @realDonaldTrump he has more smarts than any one of the politicians - he TRUMPED again ! #Trump #tcot #Election2016 "

" @CodyShirk @genemarks @Entrepreneur @realDonaldTrump Because he speaks & acts like a real person; not like a slimy, calculated politician."

" @beck_coulter @realDonaldTrump Trump is the ONLY person capable of fixing this corrupt, bankrupt, divided country! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain "

Congrats @LindseyGrahamSC . You just got 4 points in your home state of SC—far better than zero nationally. You’re only 26 pts behind me.

. @GovernorPataki did a terrible job as Governor of New York. If he ran again, he would have lost in a landslide. He and Graham ZERO in polls

Jeb Bush just talked about my border proposal to build a "fence." It's not a fence, Jeb, it's a WALL, and there's a BIG difference!

Asians are very offended that JEB said that anchor babies applies to them as a way to be more politically correct to hispanics. A mess!

In a clumsy move to get out of his "anchor babies" dilemma, where he signed that he would not use the term and now uses it, he blamed ASIANS

Jeb Bush never uses his last name on advertising, signage, materials etc. Is he ashamed of the name BUSH? A pretty sad situation. Go Jeb!

"@PatrickStinard: @megynkelly Kelly File was much better without Megyn Kelly. Her replacement while she was out on vacation was much better!

I liked The Kelly File much better without @megynkelly . Perhaps she could take another eleven day unscheduled vacation!

. @megynkelly must have had a terrible vacation, she is really off her game. Was afraid to confront Dr. Cornel West. No clue on immigration!

" @glendabelle_11 @FoxNewsInsider @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Trump supporters- volunteer ,contribute, assist campaign etc .We need Trump

Markets are crashing - all caused by poor planning and allowing China and Asia to dictate the agenda. This could get very messy! Vote Trump.

As I have long stated, we are so tied in with China and Asia that their markets are now taking the U.S. market down. Get smart U.S.A.

New Reuters Poll just came out and has me at 32%, highest number yet.The silent majority is back and we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

The last thing we need is another Bush in the White House. Would be the same old thing (remember "read my lips, no more taxes"). GREATNESS!

Jeb Bush has a photoshopped photo for an ad which gives him a black left hand and much different looking body. Jeb just can't get it right!

Jeb Bush is weak on illegal immigration, in favor of common core, bad on women's health issues and thinks the Iraq war was a good thing.

Now that I started my war on illegal immigration and securing the border, most other candidates are finally speaking up. Just politicians!

It has just been confirmed by the City of Mobile, Alabama, that there were 30,000 people at last nights event, making it #1for pol season.

How is Bernie Sanders going to defend our country if he can't even defend his own microphone? Very sad!

Thank you to the @washingtonpost for the accurate and very discriptive story on my speech in Alabama last night. It was a great evening!

I had 15,000 people in Phoenix but @politico said "the rooms capacity is just over 2000." But said Bernie Sanders had 11,000 in same room.

. @politico covers me more inaccurately than any other media source, and that is saying something. They go out of their way to distort truth!

Alabama was great last night, amazing people. 30,000 folks was largest crowd of political season. Nice!

. @jessebwatters , You did a great job hosting @oreillyfactor . Everybody loved it! Thank you for the nice words.

Dow dives more than 500 points - down 9% from high. Be careful!

Leaving for Mobile, Alabama, right now - can't be late!

Boston incident is terrible. We need energy and passion, but we must treat each other with respect. I would never condone violence.

" @AmyMek Every Time I see @realDonaldTrump address a crowd I want to start chanting USA, USA, USA! #AmericanPride is Back #Trump2016 "

How crazy - 7.5% of all births in U.S. are to illegal immigrants, over 300,000 babies per year. This must stop. Unaffordable and not right!

Jeb Bush signed memo saying not to use the term "anchor babies," offensive. Now he wants to use it because I use it. Stay true to yourself!

Alabama will shine tomorrow. It will be a big and glorious day!

We are going to make our country so strong again, so great again. No more ripping off the United States. We will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

. @WNTonight please correct your story tonight. The public is fed-up with bad reporting for the sake of sensationalizing something!

. @TomLlamasABC cannot report the news truthfully. Why not apologize for your fraudulent story on World News Tonight.Gang members & criminals

@ABCPolitics must apologize. My statement "we're going to get them out so fast, so quick" applied to hard core criminals & gang members. LIE

Just got back from New Hampshire. Amazing people, we all had a great time together!

Will be in New Hampshire and then on @CNN Special at 9 PM tonight.

. @MarkSteynOnline - Thank you and great job on @seanhannity tonight!

I am looking forward to being in New Hampshire tomorrow. The silent majority is taking our country back. We will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

" @aduanebrown New CNN/ORC poll: @realdonaldtrump #1 w/ 24% -- favorability rating on the rise while Jeb's declines. 60% among women!!"

" @ktumulty Polls indicate that a Trump presidency is now inevitable. #August "

If I am elected President I will immediately approve the Keystone XL pipeline. No impact on environment & lots of jobs for U.S.

" @JohnBerman Two explanations on @realDonaldTrump that seem no longer sufficient: 1) It's early. 2) It is all a media creation."

. @jasondhorowitz I am very proud of my sister, your story was terrific. Thank you so much.

When foreigners attend our great colleges & want to stay in the U.S., they should not be thrown out of our country.

I want talented people to come into this country—to work hard and to become citizens. Silicon Valley needs engineers, etc.

Listening to @rushlimbaugh on way back to Jury Duty. Fantastic show, terrific guy!

Why does @FoxNews keep George Will as a talking head? Wrong on so many subjects!

"@1776Pirate: @LindseyGrahamSC @WashTimes @madisongesiotto agreed. We need @realDonaldTrump as president ASAP."

I really enjoyed being at the Iowa State Fair. The crowds, love and enthusiasm is something I will never forget.

. @NicolleDWallace Your father is a brilliant man with wonderful sense -- therefore, you must be good!

Just got back from the Iowa State Fair. Record crowds, phenomenal people. Thank you IOWA, I will never let you down!

In the plane heading to Iowa State Fair. Will be great fun. Hopefully giving helicopter rides to some of the kids.

Making speech tonight in New Hampshire - leaving now. Fantastic people, fantastic crowd!

. @AP and @HuffingtonPost should change their fraudulent story to say THAT I DROPPED @NBC & The Apprentice to run for President!

People don’t understand that I left The Apprentice to run for Pres—the Apprentice DID NOT leave me. Bob Greenblatt & folks @NBC were GREAT!

" @DavidHerjavec @realDonaldTrump completely right on China...just watch the news #GoTrump "

The #IranDeal is a catastrophe that must be stopped. Will lead to at least partial world destruction & make Iran a force like never before.

" @mikerotondo86 Only Trump can bring us back from 20 Trillion in debt... He's the only one with the experience and skill set to do so."

Will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight for the full hour. Hope you enjoy it and, more importantly, hope you agree!

. @SenTedCruz had a very good debate, far better than Rand Paul.

. @ericbolling you can do much better than you did tonight on @oreillyfactor . Better luck tomorrow!

Why is @RandPaul allowed to take advantage of the people of Kentucky by running for Senator and Pres. Why should Kentucky be back up plan?

We must stop the crime and killing machine that is illegal immigration. Rampant problems will only get worse. Take back our country!

Truly weird Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky reminds me of a spoiled brat without a properly functioning brain. He was terrible at DEBATE!

Again, illegal immigrant is charged with the fatal bludgeoning of a wonderful and loved 64 year old woman. Get them out and build a WALL!

. @KatrinaCampins Thank you so much for the wonderful statements you made about me on TV. Also, keep up the great work!

. @BrandenRoderick I was pleased to see the wonderful statements you made about me to the media.I'm not surprised, you're a special person

. @OMAROSA You were fantastic on television this weekend. Thank you so much – you are a loyal friend!

Roger Ailes just called. He is a great guy & assures me that “Trump” will be treated fairly on @FoxNews . His word is always good!

. @KathieLGifford , Melania and I send our deepest condolences. Frank was a special and amazing person. He will be missed by all!

I will be interviewed on @TODAY Show at 7:00 A.M. and on Morning Joe at 7:20.

"@Libsaredemfools: @realDonaldTrump : No one knows more about business and the economy than you. You are what's right for America!"

Wonderful Frank Gifford has just passed away at age 84. He was my friend and a truly great guy! Warmest condolences to family.

It amazes me that other networks seem to treat me so much better than @FoxNews . I brought them the biggest ratings in history, & I get zip!

Small crowds at @RedState today in Atlanta. People were very angry at EWErickson, a major sleaze and buffoon who has saved me time and money

Almost universal support that "Trump won the debate." Only @FoxNews is consistantly fighting the Trump win, and I got them the ratings!

Wow, CNN just said that Donald Trump won the DEBATE, connected best with audience. Also, Time, Drudge, Newsmax, N.Y.Times and more!

. @redstate I miss you all, and thanks for all of your support. Political correctness is killing our country. "weakness."

Re Megyn Kelly quote: "you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever" (NOSE). Just got on w/thought

So many "politically correct" fools in our country. We have to all get back to work and stop wasting time and energy on nonsense!

The hatred that clown @krauthammer has for me is unbelievable – causes him to lie when many others say Trump easily won debate.

. @FoxNews you should be ashamed of yourself. I got you the highest debate ratings in your history & you say nothing but bad Dopey @krauthammer should be fired. @FoxNews

. @FrankLuntz , your so-called "focus groups" are a total joke. Don't come to my office looking for business again. You are a clown!

Wow, @megynkelly really bombed tonight. People are going wild on twitter! Funny to watch.

. @FrankLuntz I won every poll of the debate tonight by massive margins @DRUDGE_REPORT & @TIME so where did you find that dumb panel.

. @FrankLuntz is a low class slob who came to my office looking for consulting work and I had zero interest. Now he picks anti-Trump panels!

I look forward to tonight's "debate" -- but look far more forward to making America great again. It can happen!

. @realbobmassi , who does a show called "Bob Massi Is The Property Man" on @FoxNews , really knows his stuff--a total pro!

Do you notice that Hillary spews out Jeb's name as often as possible in order to give him status? She knows Trump is her worst nightmare.

Many of Hillary’s donors are the same donors as Jeb Bush’s—all rich, will have total control—know them well.

. @DottieandBogey Thanks for nice comments over weekend re Turnberry. You and your husband have fantastic taste! Also, great commentary.

Despite the false @nytimes story about Jeb Bush being happy with the Trump surge, he fell more than anybody & is miserable.

Wow, did the @nytimes fall into the Bush trap where his people convinced them how happy he was that I was hurting other candidates & not him

Should not raise taxes in Wisconsin, but massive budget deficit. Education, roads, etc suffering. @DanHenninger lies. @WSJ

The polls have been consistently great. The silent majority is speaking. Politicians are failing. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain !

I look forward to the debate on Thursday night & it is certainly my intention to be very nice & highly respectful of the other candidates.

Just at a news conference from Trump Turnberry in Scotland. Everybody was there & will be all over television tonite. Back on trail Saturday

Carl Cameron @FoxNews is the only reporter I know who consistently fumbles & misrepresents poll results. He has been so wrong & he hates it!

Getting ready to leave for my GREAT resort, Turnberry, in Scotland. Hosting The Women's British Open (biggest tournament). Will be back Sat.

I really like the Koch Brothers (members of my P.B. Club), but I don't want their money or anything else from them. Cannot influence Trump!

People like lawyer Elizabeth Beck and failed writer Harry Hurt & others talk about me but know nothing about me—crazy!

How can a dummy dope like Harry Hurt, who wrote a failed book about me but doesn’t know me or anything about me, be on TV discussing Trump?

Trump Will Make America GREAT!!!! #ChangeTheWorldIn5Words

I truly LOVE all of the millions of people who are sticking with me despite so many media lies. There is a great SILENT MAJORITY looming!

Thank you @Morning_Joe for throwing the pathetic reporter from the failing and money losing Daily Beast off the air. Really cool!

So many people who know nothing about me are commenting all over T.V. and the media as though they have great D.J.T. insight. Know NOTHING!

. @CNN Why is somebody (Beck) I beat so soundly all of a sudden an expert on Donald Trump (all over television). She knows nothing about me.

.CNN & @CNNPolitics Lawyer Elizabeth Beck did a terrible job against me, she lost (I even got legal fees). I loved beating her,she was easy

Lawyer Elizabeth Beck was easy for me to beat. Ask her clients if they are happy with her results against me. Got total win and legal fees.

. @CNN & @CNNPolitics did not say that lawyer Beck lost the case and I got legal fees. Also, she wanted to breast pump in front of me at dep.

Public Policy Polling (PPP) has just come out with a major poll putting me #1 with Hispanics - leading all Republican candidates.Told you so

A nation WITHOUT BORDERS is not a nation at all. We must have a wall. The rule of law matters. Jeb just doesn’t get it.

While I’m beating my opponents in the polls, I’m also beating lobbyists, special interests & donors that are supporting them with billions.

Great news, I’m now leading in most polls w/ new CNN poll also having me #1. NBC, I am #1 in NH by a lot, #2 in Iowa, close & gaining.

The ultra liberal and seriously failing Des Moines Register is BEGGING my team for press credentials to my event in Iowa today-but they lie!

Big poll just out by @TheEconomist has me in 1st. place by a lot. A great honor but we have a long way to go to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I will be interviewed on @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:00. Will be talking about the poor treatment of our veterans, illegal immigration, etc.

Look how small the pages have become @WSJ . Looks like a tabloid—saving money I assume!

This story is no longer about John McCain, it’s about our horribly treated vets. Illegals are treated better than our wonderful veterans.

It was only after I informed NBC that I wouldn't do the Apprentice that they became upset w/ me. They couldn’t care less about “inclusion"

" @amit_ @realdonaldtrump I agree 100%. McCain is fighting for illegal immigrant but never did anything for our Vets."

" @VetApologist This is big criticism of the Republican field. Speak truth and stop being so PC. This is why @realDonaldTrump resonates!"

" @johnjcarp61 At least we're talking about the #VA ! We weren't a month ago! @realDonaldTrump @JohnMcCain "

We will soon be at a point with our incompetent politicians where we will be treating illegal immigrants better than our veterans.

I will be making some very big campaign stops next week - big crowds and tremendous energy! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN

The Republican Party must get tougher and smarter, and fast, or it will go down to a very big defeat - just like the last two times!

The Veterans Administration is in shambles and our veterans are suffering greatly. John McCain has done nothing to help them but talk.

John McCain called thousands of people "crazies" when they came to seek help on illegal immigration last week in Phoenix. He owes apology!

"@sloopjohnb15: @realDonaldTrump @SharylAttkisson I'm on the #TrumpTrain2016 "

One of the reasons I am no fan of John McCain is that our Vets are being treated so badly by him and the politicians. I will fix VA quickly.

Why would anybody listen to @MittRomney ? He lost an election that should have easily been won against Obama. By the way,so did John McCain!

Congrats to the new Gov. of Texas, @GregAbbott_TX , for taking a tough & bold stance at the border. Should have been done long ago by Perry.

I have a proven track record supporting our Veterans. Veterans deserve universal access to care. VA scandal proves politicians are inept.

It's a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our Veterans that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care. 

I will make this right for our great Vets!

All he does is go on television is talk, talk, talk, but incapable of doing anything.

The Veterans of our country have been treated like third class citizens for many years John McCain has failed miserably to fix the situation and to make it possible for Veterans to successfully manage their lives. 

Captured or not, all our soldiers are heroes!

In addition to doing a lousy job in taking care of our Vets, John McCain let us down by losing to Barack Obama in his run for President!

Just left Family Leadership Summit in Iowa, got a standing ovation from many wonderful people. I will be back soon.

I am now in Iowa getting ready to speak. People are always amazed to find out that I am Protestant (Presbyterian). GREAT.

The $10 billion (net worth) is AFTER all debt and liabilities. So simple to understand but @CNN & @CNNPolitics is just plain dumb!

Ratings starved @CNN and @CNNPolitics does not cover me accurately. Why can't they get it right - it's really not that hard!

Made a speech in Arkansas last night before a record GOP crowd. Great spirit and amazing people. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

It's driving @ariannahuff & the money losing @HuffingtonPost post crazy that I am #1 in their poll and they only write bad stories about me!

The liberal clown @ariannahuff told her minions at the money losing @HuffingtonPost to cover me as enterainment. I am #1 in Huff Post Poll.

Get rid of gun free zones. The four great marines who were just shot never had a chance. They were highly trained but helpless without guns.

Thoughts and prayers to the families of the four great Marines killed today.

. @GovernorPerry failed on the border. He should be forced to take an IQ test before being allowed to enter the GOP debate.

. @GovernorPerry just gave a pollster quote on me. He doesn't understand what the word demagoguery means.

. @SenJohnMcCain should be defeated in the primaries. Graduated last in his class at Annapolis--dummy!

The thousands of people that showed up for me in Phoenix were amazing Americans. @SenJohnMcCain called them "crazies"--must apologize!

The worst show in Las Vegas, in my opinion, is @pennjillette . Hokey garbage. New York show even worse!

I loved firing goofball atheist Penn @pennjillette on The Apprentice. He never had a chance. Wrote letter to me begging for forgiveness.

I hear @pennjillette show on Broadway is terrible. Not surprised, boring guy (Penn). Without The Apprentice, show would have died long ago.

" @Britinnv @realDonaldTrump Would the people of US prefer a liar @HillaryClinton or a man that speaks the truth and facts!! No Brainer hey!"

" @kavemanrj @realDonaldTrump Amazing work trump! I believe you will do the same for our country."

Getting ready to land in Charlottesville, Virginia, at Trump Vineyards, another job producing development that I bought and made AMAZING!

I can't believe that President Obama isn't able or willing to make just one phone call to the family of Kate Steinle.Come on Pres-MAKE CALL!

Matt Harvey @Mets -- Don't let the @NYDailyNews get you down---nobody reads it. Play well.

"@NorthStarMF: @realDonaldTrump love you, please fix america!"

Let Pete Rose into the Baseball Hall of Fame. It's time, he has paid a big and very long price!

I absolutely support Kate’s Law—in honor of the beautiful Kate Steinle who was gunned down in SF by an illegal immigrant.

" @SaintPetersblog Part of me really, really likes @realDonaldTrump . The man is breathtakingly honest. Have to give him credit."

Mexico’s totally corrupt gov’t looks horrible with El Chapo’s escape—totally corrupt. U.S. paid them $3 billion.

The joke around town is that I freed El Chapo from the Mexican prison because the timing was so good w/ my statements on border security.

. @McLaughlinGroup Greatly appreciate yr wonderful comments this weekend. People of “great accomplishment” should easily quality for prez.

Isn’t it interesting that now that I’m #1 in the polls, the networks show polls that are a month old!

"@bdean1468 @jlangdale @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton @CNN SAY IT LOUD & SAY IT PROUD - - WE WANT TRUMP!!!!!!"

When will people, and the media, start to apologize to me for my statement, "Mexico is sending....", which turned out to be true? El Chapo

El Chapo and the Mexican drug cartels use the border unimpeded like it was a vacuum cleaner, sucking drugs and death right into the US, likewise, billions of dollars gets brought into Mexico through the border. We get the killers, drugs & crime, they get the money! 

The U.S. will invite El Chapo, the Mexican drug lord who just escaped prison, to become a U.S. citizen because our "leaders" can't say no!

Now that the Mexican drug lord escaped from prison, everyone is saying that most of the cocaine etc. coming into the U.S. comes over border! but that's what I've been saying. Very unfair treatment by the media! 

I hear that sleepy eyes @chucktodd will be fired like a dog from ratings starved Meet The Press? I can't imagine what is taking so long!

Can you envision Jeb Bush or Hillary Clinton negotiating with 'El Chapo', the Mexican drug lord who escaped from prison?  Trump, however, would kick his ass! 

Sleep eyes @ChuckTodd is killing Meet The Press. Isn't he pathetic? Love watching him fail!

Mexico's biggest drug lord escapes from jail. Unbelievable corruption and USA is paying the price. I told you so!

Phoenix Convention Center officials did not want to have thousands of people standing outside in the heat, so they let them in. A GREAT day!

Convention Center officials in Phoenix don't want to admit that they broke the fire code by allowing 12-15,000 people in 4,000 code room.

I will not be able to attend the Miss USA pageant tomorrow night because I am campaigning in Phoenix. Wishing all well!

Getting ready to go to Las Vegas (Freedom Fest) - great crowd. Then on to amazing Phoenix - that will be a total happening! Love America.

"@PHATWHODAT: @realDonaldTrump Trump 2016 yard signs. Where can we get them?" Everywhere!

Boycott @Macys and @Univision . MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Has anyone seen the financials of @Univision . They are doing really badly. Too much debt and not enough viewers. Need money fast. Funny!

I love that thousands of people are boycotting @Macys and cutting up credit cards. No guts no glory. This really backfired - love it!

Look forward to being in Phoenix tomorrow at 2:00 P.M. Hottest ticket in entire country. Was supposed to be 500 people, now many thousands!

" @Mitestarossa Please follow @realDonaldTrump ...We already know what all the other politicians will do. #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain "

" @kpmck63 Stay the course Mr. Trump! It's easier for others to attack you because you are saying the things that they won't. #Truth "

Iran continues to delay the nuclear deal while doing many bad things behind our backs. Time to WALK and double the sanctions. Stop payments!

BREAKING - Border security rally in Phoenix, AZ at 2PM MST has been moved to @PhoenixConvCtr ! Build a wall! Let's Make America Great Again!

I'm on @CNN 's @AC360 tonight @8pm & @FoxNews ' @seanhannity @10PM discussing immigration and lots of other things. #LetsMakeAmericaGreatAgain

Obama and Republicans are hollowing out our military. Now want to cut troop levels. Lowest level in over 20 years.

" @tommyz63 @Reince let Trump speak. He is only saying what the rest of us, including you, already know #Illegals are a huge problem!"

" @rdbrewer4 Trump: Keep throwing those giant hand grenades into the amnesty debate. You're pissing off all the right people in the GOP."

Why does a failed magazine like @Forbes constantly seek out trivial nonsense? Their circulation way down. @Clare_OC

Dummy @Clare_OC @Forbes : Tiny fragrance deal with Parlux means nothing. Still sold at Trump Tower...

Dummy @Clare_OC from failing @Forbes magazine: NASCAR deal was 1 nite ballroom, ESPN was small golf outing...

Dummy writer @Clare_OC from failing @Forbes magazine works so hard to make such trivial license deals look important…

"@gomrunner @realDonaldTrump keep up the tempo and don't listen to the RNC! You are correctly presenting what people want."

" @customwww @Clare_OC @Forbes Again ..not news.. news is.. he leads NC & will have NH on next true poll.. stop attacking the truth."

Watched chief negotiator for Iran on @charlierose last night. He is far smarter than our reps—increase sanctions and walk!

" @rbern11162 @SharNeal Donald Trump , keep it up you only get flack when you are close to the target, I support you completely"

" @SharNeal @ericbolling @TheFive a lot of us support Trump because of his support to stop illegals from killing anyone else"

" @_JoshBishop @ppppolls gop or dem, you have to love Trumps blunt honesty. So many things wrong most won't point out. Borders big problem"

Totally false reporting on my call with @Reince Priebus. He called me, ten minutes, said I hit a “nerve", doing well, end!

You mean George Bush sends our soldiers into combat, they are severely wounded, and then he wants $120,000 to make a boring speech to them?

Jeb's brother George insisted on a $100,000 fee and $20,000 for a private jet to speak at a charity for severely wounded vets. Not nice!

Do you believe that highly overrated political pundit @krauthammer said this is the best Republican field in 35 years. What a dope!

" @greta just read @realDonaldTrump going to Phoenix to give speech on illegal immigration on Saturday" That is correct. I look forward to it

"@CaseyBierer America needs to hear the truth. Keep it up, Mr. Trump. You can help us make America great again. Never give up."

"@bdean1468: @realDonaldTrump DONALD! DONALD! DONALD!!! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 #trumpforpresident "

I said simply that the Mexican leaders and negotiators are smarter than ours and that the Mexican gov't is pushing their hard core to U.S.

Thank you @loudobbsnews , I will be trying very hard to prove you right - great show!

Jeb Bush will never secure our border or negotiate great trade deals for American workers. Jeb doesn't see & can't solve the problems.

I appreciate the GOP candidates who remain strong on border security. They know I am right. A nation without borders cannot survive.

Rick Perry failed at the border. Now he is critical of me. He needs a new pair of glasses to see the crimes committed by illegal immigrants.

"@thedemonking18: Late night confessions: I think Donald Trump would be a good president"

Miss Universe, Paulina Vega, criticized me for telling the truth about illegal immigration, but then said she would keep the crown-Hypocrite

"@FrankieEMT_B: @realDonaldTrump You have my vote already! We don't need another Obama, it's time for someone who knows how to lead!"

Why would Republican candidates want the support of Mitt Romney. He lost an election against Obama that should NEVER have been lost!

"@MikeG_Beats: @realDonaldTrump #Trump2016 "

What about the undocumented immigrant with a record who killed the beautiful young women (in front of her father) in San Fran. Get smart!

HAPPY 4TH OF JULY TO EVERYONE! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

"@roparsons: @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends It is so refreshing to see a candidate with a backbone. Mr. Trump you have my vote!"

I will be on @foxandfriends this morning at 8:30. Enjoy!

. @TheJuanWilliams you never speak well of me & yet when I saw you at Fox you ran over like a child and wanted a picture. Please share pic!

. @marcorubio what do you say to the family of Kathryn Steinle in CA who was viciously killed b/c we can't secure our border? Stand up for US

My heartfelt condolences to the family of Kathryn Steinle. Very, very sad!

"A nation that cannot control its borders is not a nation." - President Ronald Reagan

Wow, Huffington Post just stated that I am number 1 in the polls of Republican candidates. Thank you, but the work has just begun!

Mexican leaders and negotiators are much tougher and smarter than those of the U.S. Mexico is killing us on jobs and trade. WAKE UP!

As Governor of Texas, Rick Perry could have done far more to secure the border - but that's O.K., I like him anyway! @GovernorPerry

"@yeswecandeport: @realDonaldTrump @Macys I am sure rocketing up to polls at the cost of losing a place to sell his ties is killing him."

"@tonyarolandtr: @Youxia88 @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump @Macys The American ppl are taking a stand! We are fighting back!!!"

" @chipman88 @realDonaldTrump @DavidDCarpenter @lafrana @Macys I didn't know Macy's was still in business. Oh well, still not going there."

Obama once again just missed a self-imposed deadline with Iran. Our leadership is weak & ineffective. Double the sanctions!

" @LepleyAmanda @realDonaldTrump @DagnyRed @Karentalk @ForAmerica amen honey honest is honest dont back down support the truth!"

" @mstrbass2000 @DashMan18 @AppSame taking a stand against stupid companies over reacting to free speech, nothing trump said wasn't true"

" @racheljoycowley I'm done with Macy's. Apparently, they follow the trend of trying to force legislation on every American freedom. Done!"

" @lafrana @realDonaldTrump @Macys I will not shop at Macy's. I am with you Mr Trump!"

"@JimStaricha: Mr. Trump, I truly hope you are elected. I strongly believe you have more than the skills required. We need a professional."

"@ehShaun: @realDonaldTrump knows what he's talking about. Please don't give us another Bush as president."

Who is @Macys to pretend innocence when they “racial profile” all over the place? Paid big fine!

Interesting that @Macys criticized me but just paid $650,000 in fines for racial profiling. Are they racists?

. @GovernorPataki couldn’t be elected dog catcher if he ran again—so he didn’t!

. @GovernorPataki was a terrible governor of NY, one of the worst -- would’ve been swamped if he ran again!

" @phxladydi @realDonaldTrump I truly believe you can bring America back to great. You don't cower to the media, lobbyists or anyone else."

" @tixxannatrix @Lrihendry : Now this is the @RealDonaldTrump we have come to know At least Trump speaks his mind. Doesn't cower to PC."

. @andersoncooper Anderson—Thank you for being so fair with your reporting & story last night. Greatly appreciated!

For all of those who want to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain , boycott @Macys . They are weak on border security & stopping illegal immigration.

Those who believe in tight border security, stopping illegal immigration & SMART trade deals w/other countries should boycott @Macys .

Get ready for @Oreillyfactor tonight at 8- always interesting!

" @webster07 @realDonaldTrump wish there were more people in the public eye with this attitude. It's only way 2 defeat political correctness"

" @kingjersey1 @realDonaldTrump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain they can't stand that you are speaking for the American people"

I love the Mexican people, but Mexico is not our friend. They're killing us at the border and they're killing us on jobs and trade. FIGHT!

We MUST have strong borders and stop illegal immigration. Without that we do not have a country. Also, Mexico is killing U.S. on trade. WIN!

"@C_Archaeology: @realDonaldTrump is our only hope @littlebytesnews #tcot "

"@TheHolyBreadcat: @realDonaldTrump Vote for Trump, he's making America to where we won't worry about illegal immigrant problems."

. @jorgeramosnews Please send me your new number, your old one’s not working. Sincerely, Donald J. Trump

Univision apologized to me but I will not accept their apology. I will be suing them for a lot of money. Miss U.S.A. contestants are hurt!

. @NYDailyNews , the dying tabloid owned by dopey clown Mort Zuckerman, puts me on the cover daily because I sell. My honor, but it is dead!

"@JasonKoster17: In @realDonaldTrump we trust.. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain "

I'll be in Iowa tonight making a speech to a record setting crowd. The word is getting out, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

The leader and negotiators representing Mexico are far smarter and more cunning than the leader and negotiators representing the U.S.!

Only very stupid people think that the United States is making good trade deals with Mexico.Mexico is killing us at the border and at trade!

. @billmaher : Bill, you are really beginning to understand what is going on with "Trump" - actually, you always knew!

When you are in a war, or even a battle, losing is not an option!

When somebody challenges you unfairly, fight back - be brutal, be tough - don't take it. It is always important to WIN!

If I win the presidency, my judicial appointments will do the right thing unlike Bush's appointee John Roberts on ObamaCare.

. @Univision cares far more about Mexico than it does about the U.S. Are they controlled by the Mexican government?

Anyone who wants strong borders and good trade deals for the US should boycott @Univision .

Once again the Bush appointed Supreme Court Justice John Roberts has let us down. Jeb pushed him hard! Remember!

I love Mexico but not the unfair trade deals that the US so stupidly makes with them. Really bad for US jobs, only good for Mexico.

Univision wants to back out of signed @MissUniverse contract because I exposed the terrible trade deals that the U.S. makes with Mexico.

Mexican gov doesn't want me talking about terrible border situation & horrible trade deals. Forcing Univision to get me to stop- no way!

" @JWCesare I appreciate @realDonaldTrump and his straight talk. Our country needs this."

" @nanaelaine7 @realDonaldTrump only YOU can make it GREAT again. Your plan is the only one inside reality. MAKE AMERICA GREAT with TRUMP"

Governor Rick Scott of Florida did really poorly on television this morning. I hope he is O.K.

I hear that dopey political pundit, Lawrence O'Donnell, one of the dumber people on television, is about to lose his show-no ratings?Too bad

"@_GOLD4MONEY: @ThePatriot143 @realDonaldTrump Trump is as Honest as they come. He wants a border and doesn't hide it. #Trumpforpresident "

We have to bring back and cherish the middle class - once the backbone and true strength of the U.S.A. It can happen!

My message, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, is beginning to take hold. Bring back our jobs, strengthen our military and borders, help our VETS!

My daughter Ivanka did great tonight in New Hampshire. The sold out crowd loved her, and she loved them. Thanks Ivanka!

. @WhoopiGoldberg had better surround herself with better hosts than Nicole Wallace, who doesn't have a clue. The show is close to death!

The ratings for The View are really low. Nicole Wallace and Molly Sims are a disaster. Get new cast or just put it to sleep. Dead T.V.

I am really beginning to respect Mark Halperin and John Heilemann as political reporters - they truly get why "Trump" poll numbers are high.

Just out, the new nationwide @FoxNews poll has me alone in 2nd place, closely behind Jeb Bush-but Bush will NEVER Make America Great Again!

Uncomfortable looking NBC reporter Willie Geist calls me to ask for favors and then mockingly smiles when he is told of my high poll numbers

Druggies, drug dealers, rapists and killers are coming across the southern border. When will the U.S. get smart and stop this travesty?

Mexico is killing the United States economically because their leaders and negotiators are FAR smarter than ours. But nobody beats Trump!

I like Mexico and love the spirit of Mexican people, but we must protect our borders from people, from all over, pouring into the U.S.

Why did @DanaPerino beg me for a tweet (endorsement) when her book was launched?

" @stevenkirk @realDonaldTrump @PatrickBuchanan great article .. At least #thedonald is finally saying what us average working people know!"

Our country is in a major crisis of incompetent leadership. We cannot continue to go on with these politicians who do nothing but talk.

Out of hundreds of deals & transactions, I have used the bankruptcy laws a few times to make deals better. Nothing personal, just business.

Almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool. Icahn, Black, Zell—but nobody says they went bankrupt!

People buy deals & immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals. It’s a very effective & commonly used business tool.

Stop saying I went bankrupt. I never went bankrupt but like many great business people have used the laws to corporate advantage—smart!

Has Charles @krauthammer ever apologized for being so totally wrong on Iraq? I called it right in every way—Make America Great Again!

George Will was a big Iraq fool. $2 trillion, thousands of lives lost -- & we got nothing! Dummy.

Goofy political pundit George Will spoke at Mar-a-Lago years ago. I didn’t attend because he’s boring & often wrong—a total dope!

Entrepreneurs: Don't tread water. Get out there and go for it.

Entrepreneurs: Achievers move forward at all times. Achievement is not a plateau, it's a beginning.

If the working, proud and productive people of our country don't start exerting their authority and views, the U.S. as we know it is doomed!

Why is no-one talking about the horrible murder of Ana Charle by ex-con thug West Spruill. Gunned down on street, naked. Why no riots here?

Billions of dollars spent on Baltimore and it's still a total mess. Leadership is needed, not dollars. Our whole country is going to hell!

I have been a guest on The View many times when it was successful show. Now the show is dying for lack of ratings. Too bad!

I wonder what the rest of the world is thinking about the United States as they watch the disgusting and out of control Baltimore riots?

Hopefully there won't be any problems in Baltimore tonight. Be calm, be cool-do not let anybody get hurt.There is just too much to live for!

The best social program, by far, is a JOB! Our jobs are being taken away from us by China and many other countries - incompetent leader.

President Obama, you have a big job to do. Go to Baltimore and bring both sides together. With proper leadership, it can be done! Do it.

Our country has to come together. We have to start working with, and really liking, each other. The whole world is watching Baltimore.

The Mayor of Baltimore said she wanted to give the rioters "space to destroy" - another real genius!

Now that the ineffective Baltimore Police have allowed the city to be destroyed, are the U.S. taxpayers expected to rebuild it (again)?

Our great African American President hasn't exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore!

Blatant and rampant property destruction in Baltimore as the police stand by and watch. Should be a lesson on how NOT to handle riots. SAD!

Wow, 15 policemen hurt in Baltimore, some badly! Where is the National Guard. Police must get tough, and fast! Thugs must be stopped.

“What counts is not necessarily the size of the dog in the fight - it's the size of the fight in the dog.” - Dwight D. Eisenhower

China has a backdoor into the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This deal does not address currency manipulation. China is laughing at us.

The Trans-Pacific Partnership will lead to even greater unemployment. Do not pass it.

Republicans should not be giving Obama fast track authority on trade. The Trans-Pacific Partnership will squeeze our manufacturing sector

The Trans-Pacific Partnership is an attack on America's business. It does not stop Japan's currency manipulation. This is a bad deal.

I want to negotiate my own, and much better, trade deals for our country. MUST INCLUDE CURRENCY MANIPULATION (and more). DO NOT LET PASS!

Congratulations to the Republicans in Congress. You are the only people Obama can out negotiate. #TimeToGetTough

"@smxtty_: Donald trump would be the greatest president" Thank you.

The reason Ed Schultz said nice things about me is that I’m the only Repub who won't cut Social Security, etc. I’ll make America rich again!

I’m a conservative, but the weakness of conservatives is that they destroy each other, whereas liberals unite to win.

With a stupid guy like Jonah Goldberg who uses “tweeting like a 14 year old girl” to hit me, no wonder the NRO is doing so poorly. @JonahNRO

People have been forced to resign positions for far less than @JonahNRO ’s “tweeting like a 14 year old girl”

. @JonahNRO You stated that I started “relentlessly tweeting like a 14-year-old girl...” Horrible insult to women. Resign now or later!

“When you can't make them see the light, make them feel the heat.” – Ronald Reagan

Republicans have once again capitulated to Obama. This time on the Iran nuclear treaty. When will it end?

" @RonnieWNichol Just viewed the video of the changes to @TurnberryBuzz. An already stunning course will now be even more spectacular"

National Review @NRO may be going out of business because of the really pathetic job being done by @JonahNRO . No talent means death - sad!

. @megynkelly Sorry, there was only one "breakout star" this weekend in New Hampshire. Just check out the local New Hampshire media!

Jonah Goldberg @JonahNRO of the once great @NRO #National Review is truly dumb as a rock. Why does @BretBaier put this dummy on his show?

As I have long been saying, South Africa is a total - and very dangerous - mess. Just watch the evening news (when not talking weather).

"@ali_khalil7: @realDonaldTrump We need you as president Mr.Trump, A leader that knows what to do!" Agree.

We are stupidly paying Iran billions of dollars that we should not be paying. Why isn't this part of the nuclear negotiations? Really dumb!

We are getting ready to protect Saudi Arabia against Iran & others-sending ships. How much are they going to pay us toward this protection.

Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl should face the death penalty for desertion - five brave soldiers died trying to bring him back. U.S. has to get tough!

If Saudi Arabia, which has been making one billion dollars a day from oil, wants our help and protection, they must pay dearly! NO FREEBIES.

Pres. Obama was touting Yemen as a great success story - it just fell. Obama doesn't know what he is doing. Saudi Arabia is in big trouble.

Entrepreneurs: Be tough, be smart, be personable, but don’t take things personally. That’s good business.

Entrepreneurs: Look at the solution, not the problem. Learn to focus on what will give results.

So many people are angry at my comments on Mexico—but face it—Mexico is totally ripping off the US. Our politicians are dummies!

"@PeritusTraining: @realDonaldTrump Donald can't be president because the left doesn't want to see America great again." Very interesting!

"@pcufinn: @realDonaldTrump Why don't you put a TRUMP fence up and do us all a favor." Great idea.

"@BasilicaCEO: Thank you, @realDonaldTrump , for your @ApprenticeNBC tribute to @Joan_Rivers . Love you both. Miss her very much."

The Mexican legal system is corrupt, as is much of Mexico. Pay me the money that is owed me now - and stop sending criminals over our border

The evening news broadcasts must stop talking about weather—boring and too many other topics.

I could fix tv talk shows that are doing poorly—there is tremendous talent out there waiting to be tapped—and nobody sees it!

Put the glamour, beauty & mystery back in the Oscars and the ratings will zoom. Also, & most importantly, the Oscars need credibility.

I told everybody the Oscars were no good—Nielsen ratings confirmed, one of the lowest ratings in history.

The @HuffingtonPost is a total joke & laughing stock of journalism, as is gross Arianna Huffington. They don’t report the facts!

I have a lawsuit in Mexico’s corrupt court system that I won but so far can’t collect. Don’t do business with Mexico!

The Oscars were a great night for Mexico & why not—they are ripping off the US more than almost any other nation.

Whether you think you can or think you can't, you're right. -- Henry Ford

Now that Mitt is gone, all we have to do is get Bush to drop out and Trump to run—and we will win!

When I broadly proclaimed Mitt “choked” – and would do it again—everybody said yeah, he’s right.

I will take full credit for Mitt Romney dropping out of the race—looks like he won’t be endorsing Trump any time soon.

Mitt did the right thing—not because he had to-- but because he never would have been given a second chance after his first fiasco

Everyone is saying the bad news is that Donald Trump is going to take credit & they are right—Mitt wouldn’t have won anyway.

Entrepreneurs: Success is good. Success with significance is even better. Work on what you will be proud to be associated with.

. @oreillyfactor - bad and very deceptive journalism. Show must be heading in wrong direction, too bad! @SarahPalinUSA

. @SarahPalinUSA was 100% correct when she stated that @oreillyfactor used us in day long tease to get people to watch, but we were not on!

"@pgatimmyd @nypost They are morons Mr. Trump, I heard your speech it was excellent. EXACTLY what America needed to hear!" Thanks.

Surprise, @oreillyfactor used my name big league in pre-ads to promote the show—then talked about everyone else but me!

Getting ready to go on @KellyandMichael - two great people!

I guess Rupert Murdoch and the @nypost don't like Donald Trump. Such false reporting about my big hit in Iowa. Even my enemies said "bull."

Wow, I have always liked the @nypost but they have really lied when they covered me in Iowa. Packed house, standing O, best speech! Sad.

Going over to @ABC to do LIVE at 9:00.

. @Lord_Sugar How did you enjoy Mar-a-Lago? It was nice having you there--my people thought you were terrific!

So many people have told me that I should host Meet the Press and replace the moron who is on now. Just too busy, especially next 10 years!

Apprentice = big hit. Miss Universe = Big hit. I always get big ratings. If I hosted Meet the Press instead of Sleepy Eyes,a smash! @NBCNews

I am convinced that sleepy eyes Chuck Todd was only a placeholder for someone else at Meet the Press. He bombed, franchise in ruins! @nbc

President Obama, our great leader, wants to declare martial law in New York City as a means of helping out with the "massive" storm.

Wow, the final ratings for the Miss Universe Pageant show that it won in all key demos - number one on Sunday. I have a winner!

As usual, the "storm of the century" was not nearly as bad as forecast. What a waste of time, energy and money!

Word is that @NBCNews is firing sleepy eyes Chuck Todd in that his ratings on Meet the Press are setting record lows. He's a real loser!

"@skinner5569: @piersmorgan @realDonaldTrump @ApprenticeNBC @MarkBurnettTV Mickey Rourke R U going on The Apprentice?"

The French police are afraid to go into many communities. How did France let this all happen, and how did the female terrorist ever escape?

"@LTaustin_: #CelebrityApprentice is my favorite reality show right now S/O @realDonaldTrump "

Entrepreneurs: Look at the solution, not the problem. Learn to focus on what will give results.

Entrepreneurs: Business is a creative endeavor. Being innovative = being open to new ideas. Keep an open mind!

Entrepreneurs: Be totally focused. Know everything you can about what you're doing. Give your work 100% of your concentrated effort.

Who is paying for that tedious Smokey Bear commercial that is on all the time - enough already!

Almost no news organizations are showing the "satirical" pictures. Gee, I wonder why? The media is usually so brave!

"@VinDaniels: @GlennNights @realDonaldTrump He is correct. France has harsh gun laws. Terrorists were carrying AK47."

I would like to thank @GolfMagazine for the really nice review of Trump National Doral - Best Renovation of the Year (and maybe all time).

Remember, when guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns!

Isn’t it interesting that the tragedy in Paris took place in one of the toughest gun control countries in the world?

If the people so violently shot down in Paris had guns, at least they would have had a fighting chance.

Congratulations to new Congressman @leezeldin being named to House Foreign Affairs Comm. and co-chair the House Republican Israel Caucus.

Why does Obama continue to release the worst of the worst from Gitmo?! Look at Paris and wake up!

My condolences and prayers to the victims of the terrorist attack in Paris.

In the end, you're measured not by how much you undertake but by what you finally accomplish.

Without passion you don't have energy, without energy you have nothing. Find work that you love and the energy will be there.

If you're interested in 'balancing' work and pleasure, stop trying to balance them. Instead make your work more pleasurable.

What separates the winners from the losers is how a person reacts to each new twist of fate.

Sometimes by losing a battle you find a new way to win the war.

Where’s the electability? Jeb is losing to HRC by 13 points. A Bush will never beat a Clinton. Wake up @GOP !

" @ronmeier123 @bryabntshirley1 Even the Elf On The Shelf is STARTING to get Restless! On JANUARY 4th the APPRENTICE is going to be Great!"

. @CoachDanMullen Great to have you and your GREAT team at Trump National Doral. Go out and finish your fantastic season in style!

If you can’t see it, it will never happen. Bring your vision to fruition through perseverance and hard work. That will build momentum.

Sometimes your best investments are the ones you don't make.

If you're going to be thinking, you may as well think big.

Deals are my art form. Other people paint beautifully or write poetry. I like making deals, preferably big deals. That's how I get my kicks.

"@linsey_gile: Wise words spoken by Donald Trump: Sometimes by losing a battle, you find a new way to win the war."

Negotiation is an art. Treat it like one.

Entrepreneurs: Absorb, assess, and then act. Don't negate your own power. Whatever you've been dealt, know you can deal with it.

“The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.” – Walt Disney

Romney was the architect of ObamaCare. Bush’s Chief Justice legalized the monstrosity. Notice a trend?

A Clinton already defeated a Bush. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing twice & expecting a different result.

If only Obama would treat @IsraeliPM @netanyahu with the same respect he awards tyrants. Very strange & dangerous for our national security.

Obama now wants to deny due process to the police. He’ll give all constitutional rights to the terrorists but not our cops.

" @SeeCLyde1 Mr. Trump I believe Sir we can take this country back and make it greater than it's ever been before! God bless you!" Thanks.

" @WartenbergHans @JoshuaBlack2014 One of the many things I admire about you Mr. Trump is that you aren't afraid to speak your mind." True!

Not so smart after all … Man with name on Duke law library must pay me legal fees after Trump trial victory.

Should have settled … Ft Lauderdale plaintiffs must pay me close to $400k in legal fees after Trump trial victory.

Pigs get slaughtered … again. Ft Lauderdale plaintiffs must pay me close to $400k in legal fees after Trump trial victory.

“Some people spend an entire lifetime wondering if they made a difference in the world.The Marines don't have that problem.”- Ronald Reagan

Isn't it interesting that immediately after September 11th, everybody was asking for, and indeed demanding, torture of any kind. No reports!

When terrorists are beheading and executing American citizens in such a brutal way,the report on torture should be the least of our concerns

The terrorists cut off the heads of Americans and laugh, then want to sell us the bodies for $1,000,000. We fight over sleep deprivation!

These Islamists chop Americans’ heads off and want to destroy us. We should be applauding the CIA, not persecuting them.

If America was under the threat of imminent attack, would Obama use torture or a kiss?

Policy towards our enemies: Hit them hard, hit them fast, hit them often & then tell them it was because they are the enemy!

Obama & Democrat leaders did a great disservice by releasing the papers on torture. The world is laughing at us—they think we are fools!

I will miss @Letterman & doing his show. He was always intriguing & smart. You never knew what would happen -- but he was fair!

President Obama has absolutely no control (or respect) over the African American community-they have fared so poorly under his presidency.

Who is the moron who decided to release the Ferguson grand jury findings after 9:00 o'clock in the evening. What were they thinking?

Our country is totally fractured and, with our weak leadership in Washington, you can expect Ferguson type riots and looting in other places

Sadly, because president Obama has done such a poor job as president, you won't see another black president for generations!

As China and the rest of the World continue to rip off the U.S. economically, they laugh at us and our president over the riots in Ferguson!

Can you imagine what Putin and all of our friends and enemies throughout the world are saying about the U.S. as they watch the Ferguson riot

If the decision by the grand jury in Ferguson was the exact opposite, you would still be having the riots right now!

Despite having a black president, the racial divide seems greater than it has in decades.If Obama were a leader, this would not be the case

"@TheRealZach49: This is why we need @realDonaldTrump in office. @BarackObama doesn't know how to keep order"

Why would they announce a finding of the grand jury in Ferguson at 9:00 in the evening - a prime time for riots! Not smart.

Iran and the United States just pushed deadline back SEVEN MONTHS on working out a nuclear deal. Iran is tapping along our bad negotiators!

ISIS is starting its own currency. May be stronger than the dollar if ObamaCare is fully implemented.

There is no excuse for riots in Ferguson regardless of the grand jury outcome.

Fact – Amnesty lowers wages and invites more lawlessness. Obama has unilaterally cancelled any chance of immigration reform.

Premiering on January 4th, the 14th season of @ApprenticeNBC will have major fireworks every episode. The Board Room is electric!

Congratulations to Chuck Hagel on one of the shortest tenures as Sec. of Defense. Another terrible appointee by Obama.

" @ddrocks777 . @realDonaldTrump Cannot wait for the newest season of The Celebrity Apprentice!! I've been a huge fan since it started" Great!

You don't necessarily need the best location. What you need is the best deal. -- The Art of the Deal

If we do not protect the rule of law then we can expect even more illegals to cross the border. Obama’s executive amnesty is dangerous.

Iraq should be paying us while we fight ISIS. Give the money to the families of our brave soldiers.

I enjoyed meeting with @MattBlunt @TrumpTowerNY to discuss why our government must address currency manipulation. Many US jobs are at stake.

“Success in golf depends less on strength of body than upon strength of mind and character.” - Arnold Palmer

Repubs must not allow Pres Obama to subvert the Constitution of the US for his own benefit & because he is unable to negotiate w/ Congress.

I am no fan of Bill Cosby but never-the-less some free advice - if you are innocent, do not remain silent. You look guilty as hell!

" @jakemurray_32 @realDonaldTrump the haters are just jealous of your unbelievable success #Trump2016 " Thank you.

If you don’t publicize your successes, your competitors will be sure to belittle them. Get the word out!

“If you like your plan you keep it.” = “Gruber is just some adviser.” Two of Obama’s greatest lies told to the American public.

“Get in. Get it done. Get it done right. Get out.” – Fred C. Trump (My father!)

For those that constantly say that “global warming” is now “climate change”—they changed the name. The name global warming wasn’t working

"@joblink31: @realDonaldTrump Trump is so important, that every time he's makes a decision, it's good for the economy ."

There are many Jonathan Gruber types selling the global warming "stuff" - and they really do believe the American public is stupid.

Entrepreneurs: always remember that deals are fluid. Terms are always negotiable and time can be the best option for success.

“The true competitors are the ones who always play to win.” – Tom Brady @Patriots

ObamaCare will continue to stop entrepreneurship, slow growth and halt research & development. Defund, Repeal & Replace!

“Remember that some things are worth waiting for. Plans can change, sometimes for good reason.” – Trump Never Give Up

At least ObamaCare/RomneyCare architect Gruber admitted, albeit privately, that we were lied to by Obama. Gang of Liars.

Congratulations to @SixteenChicago @TrumpChicago for being honored with a @MichelinGuideChi two-star rating again this year!

Just like Jonathan Gruber viciously lied & called Americans “stupid” on ObamaCare, many consultants are doing the same on Global Warming.

" @ApartmentMgr @realDonaldTrump played #Doral #White on Sunday what a gorgeous course you're doing GREAT things there #Golf #Resort " Thanks.

Obama’s China ‘climate’ deal binds America with language of ‘will’ curb emissions now while China only ‘intends’ to curb in 2030. Bad deal!

ObamaCare/RomneyCare architect Gruber was paid over $6M with our tax dollars yet Obama only claims he ‘was some adviser.’

Deportations are now at a record low. Obama manipulated the numbers to lie to the public that they were at a record high. Secure the border!

I will be on @foxandfriends in ten minutes - enjoy!

They finally let our Marine out of a Mexican prison, no thanks to Obama. Way too long. Such an event should never be allowed to happen again

Obama will quarantine all soldiers returning from Africa for 21 days. But he still allows all who contract Ebola into country? Hypocrite.

Obama admin. called @netanyahu "chickenshit." Ironic since Bibi was an IDF Special Forces commando while Obama was a community organizer.

" @Lps320P @TrumpDoral @realDonaldTrump Love this place. I'm a Trump resort traveler for life!" Great and thanks.

In game 7 of the World Series tonight, the Giants are making a big mistake in not starting their ace against K.C., even with two days rest.

Just out - the POLAR ICE CAPS are at an all time high, the POLAR BEAR population has never been stronger. Where the hell is global warming?

The U.S. rocket that blew-up and crashed yesterday is emblematic of the United States under Obama. Nothing works, be it a rocket or website.

"@cindylestrada: @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump good interview. we definitely need more conservatives to speak up."

President Obama strongly considering a plan to bring non-U.S. citizens with Ebola to the United States for treatment. Now I know he's nuts!

Watch me on @SeanHannity 's show at 10PM tonight on @FoxNews

Success requires 100% of your focus and 100% of your effort. Don't sell yourself short.

Keep your momentum. Without momentum, a lot of great ideas go nowhere.

Mark Udall was the deciding vote for ObamaCare & now 250,000 Coloradans were dropped from their plans. Vote @CoryGardner !

John Foust is a liberal who supports ObamaCare and opposes Ebola travel ban. Send Conservative @BarbaraComstock to Congress!

“I believe anybody who is not afraid to fail is a winner.” - @JoeTorre

All the governors are already backing off of the Ebola quarantines. Bad decision that will lead to more mayhem.

WH refused a meeting with the Israeli Defense Minister. If only Obama hated Iran as much as he dislikes Israel.

ObamaCare has brought skyrocketing premium increases & unaffordable deductibles which will lead to less care & job losses.

Achievers move forward at all times. Achievement is not a plateau, it's a beginning. Don't waste time treading water.

Will be on @foxandfriends at 7.00. (30 minutes). A great deal to talk about including Ebola quarantine.

"@REALNickVenti: I'd vote for @realDonaldTrump way before I'd vote for Hillary." Great!

There are just so many penalties and such long commercials in these NFL games that they are no longer worth watching. Soft hitting & boring!

I would absolutely consider investing in Atlantic City again, great and hard working people, but much would have to change-taxes, regs., etc

Yes, I won the right to have my name taken off Trump Plaza in A.C. because it was not operated up to a very high standard and NO involvement

I made a fortune in Atlantic City, got out years ago (great timing), and havn't been back in many years. I have NOTHING to do with A.C.

With all that is happening with Ebola, including the doctor who so easily came back to New York, Obama still refuses to stop the flights!

“Yesterday's home runs don't win today's games.” – Babe Ruth

There is ZERO margin for error on Ebola. Are we confident in Obama when he can’t even make a website for $5 Billion?

Michelle Nunn supports Amnesty, a weak border & ObamaCare. She is an Obama liberal. Send DC an independent voice. Vote @Perduesenate !

Canadian PM Harper immediately called the Ottawa attack terrorism. At least North America has a strong leader who lives in reality.

The Ebola doctor who just flew to N.Y. from West Africa and went on the subway, bowling and dining is a very SELFISH man-should have known!

President Obama, you are a complete and total disaster, but you have a chance to do something great and important: STOP THE FLIGHTS!

President Obama has a major meeting on the N.Y.C. Ebola outbreak, with people flying in from all over the country, but decided to play golf!

I never thought I'd say it in my lifetime, but President Barack Hussein Obama, aka Barry Sotoro, is a far worse president than Jimmy Carter!

I have been saying for weeks for President Obama to stop the flights from West Africa. So simple, but he refused. A TOTAL incompetent!

Ebola has been confirmed in N.Y.C., with officials frantically trying to find all of the people and things he had contact with.Obama's fault

If this doctor, who so recklessly flew into New York from West Africa,has Ebola,then Obama should apologize to the American people & resign!

There is a good possibility that a person who treated patients in West Africa and who FLEW into New York has Ebola. Touched many, bedlam!

Double digit premium increases because of ObamaCare. Dems trying to delay showing numbers until after election, but news is spreading fast!

Ben Bradlee was truly one of the greats. What an amazing life he led. My warmest condolences to Dino & the whole family. #BenBradlee

I'm going to D.C. today to check on the hotel I'm building on Penn. AVE., and then being honored by the Wharton School of Finance, the BEST!

Why are we letting the three girls, who left the U.S. to join ISIS, back into the country? How stupid has our once respected country become!

If there is one more Ebola case in the U.S., a full travel ban will be instituted. This common sense move should have been done long ago!

"@BeyerTristen: @realDonaldTrump A man of business and success, please run for president and fix this country "

The United States troops which were sent to West Africa have only gotten 4 hours of Ebola training - very unfair to them and their families!

The United States, under President Obama, has truly become the "gang that couldn't shoot straight." Everything he touches turns to garbage!

The U.S. accidentally air dropped a large shipment of military weapons and supplies right into the middle of ISIS as enemy laughs! Very sad!

Negotiation is an art. Treat it like one.

Don’t believe Kay Hagan on Ebola travel ban. She also promised that you would keep your healthcare plan under ObamaCare. Vote @ThomTillis !

Obama will let Ebola fly into US & drugrunners cross our border daily. But he won't pressure Mexico on Sgt. Tahmooressi. #FreeOurMarine

I was never a fan of Bush, in fact, he was so bad he gave us Obama! But Obama is truly a pathetic excuse of a president, can't get any worse

President Obama has made one mistake after another for a very long time, and the people of the United States are just plain tired of it!

"@Jennifer75AR: @realDonaldTrump Great interview, DT! Can't wait for next week! Run for President! #Trump2016 "

I will be on @foxandfriends at 7.00 - 45 minutes. Talking about Ebola, Obama and other strange U.S. happenings!

I just returned from Iowa - what a beautiful state. The people are amazing and the event for Congressman Steve King was a great success!

Do you believe Obama just said that America would be "less safe" with a travel ban from West Africa.This is the thinking of a total mad man!

The lobbyist and political hack that President Obama just appointed as the "Ebola Czar," just missed his first major meeting on Ebola-A joke

I'm leaving for Iowa now - will be great!

If I were president Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi would be let out of jail with one phone call. If not,Mexico would pay a price like never before!

Do you think the 14 African nations that are banning West Africans from coming into their nations are being called racists? Perhaps not!

14 African nations have totally banned West Africans from entering their nations. Likewise many other nations. But the U.S. = "COME ON IN"

Obama just appointed an Ebola Czar with zero experience in the medical area and zero experience in infectious disease control. A TOTAL JOKE!

If you can’t see it, you can’t make it happen. Entrepreneurs, chase your dreams with resolute focus & determination. Be positive!

Now Michelle Nunn will not admit she voted for Obama. Of course she did. Nunn supports ObamaCare & is anti-Second Amendment.

The new Ebola czar will report to the WH & NSA adviser Susan Rice. More mismanagement & duplicity with CDC. Obama is terrible executive.

. @yuSiddiqui @piersmorgan @rustyrockets I got much better—no contest—I got Melania!

Looks like Obama will not stop the very potentially dangerous flights to and from West Africa. What the hell is wrong with this guy?

. @katyperry I watched Russell Brand and I think his mind is fried - he looks really bad. Russell is a total joke, a dummy who is lost!

. @katyperry Katy, what the hell were you thinking when you married loser Russell Brand. There is a guy who has got nothing going, a waste!

I watched Russell Brand @rustyrockets on the @jimmyfallon show the other night—what the hell do people see in Russell—a major loser!

The Ebola nurse should NEVER have been allowed to fly to Cleveland and (amazing) back again. Nothing works in our once great country anymore

I am starting to think that there is something seriously wrong with President Obama's mental health. Why won't he stop the flights. Psycho!

It is time for the airline pilots, flight attendants and the airlines themselves to stop flights to and from West Africa. Do it right now!

"@Nicolebnagy: Donald Trump should really consider running for President. He certainly has his head on right! @realDonaldTrump

I just had a great victory against lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman. Most of his case re Trump U. was thrown out or gutted. Little remains

I can't believe that Mitt Romney would run for president again. He had his chance and blew it in the last weeks of the race.

A nurse in Dallas who treated Ebola patient Thomas Duncan was allowed to fly to Cleveland.She should never have been so allowed! The real JV

With all of the words President Obama just dispensed at his press conference, he didn't say what we all want to hear,"I'LL STOP THE FLIGHTS"

" @Fox5Kyle @realDonaldTrump @Macys Your ties are the best hands down!" Thank you!

“I don’t think you should ever run from history. You should learn from it and embrace it.” - @LAClippers Coach Doc Rivers

Young entrepreneurs – always remember in negotiations that sometimes the best deal you make is the one you walk away from.

Our president could not make a proper website with $5B. The website still does not work. How can we feel safe about Ebola?!

Looking forward to returning to the Hawkeye state this Saturday to support my friend and strong Conservative @SteveKingIA !

Lightweight @AGSchneiderman is driving business & jobs out of NY. Only wants self publicity—a total loser!

John @CahillForAG is one of the most respected people in politics. Dopey @AGSchneiderman is one of the least respected!

President Obama has a personal responsibility to visit & embrace all people in the US who contract Ebola!

Obama still refuses to stop the flights. Is he stubborn or just plain incompetent - I say both!

"@CRRoussos: @realDonaldTrump You were 100% spot on about the judge in the Oscar Pistorius trial. Complete and utter moron."

It's Tuesday. @AGSchneiderman is wearing Revlon eyeliner today. Governor Cuomo alerted all to this.

Michelle Nunn will be a solid vote for Obama. She supports ObamaCare & opposes 2nd Amendment. Vote for @Perduesenate to change things!

We pay for Obama's travel so he can fundraise millions so Democrats can run on lies. Then we pay for his golf.

Alison Grimes will protect the 'sanctity' of her Obama ballot yet admits she voted for Hillary in primary. Hypocrite. Vote @Team_Mitch !

"@katielevan9: i love @realDonaldTrump finally someone who gets it "

"@TheRealZach49: @realDonaldTrump please run in 2016. We can't have another Obama"

So many problems in the U.S. and leadership that is hopeless...and now, on top of everything else, we just hit $18 trillion in debt!

As ISIS and Ebola spread like wildfire, the Obama administration just submitted a paper on how to stop climate change (aka global warming).

Can you believe that,with all of the problems and difficulties facing the U.S., President Obama spent the day playing golf.Worse than Carter

"If you never want to be criticized, for goodness' sake don't do anything new." -- Jeff Bezos

Happy belated birthday to Chris Wallace! Chris does a great job every week on @FoxNewsSunday . Like father, like son.

Just finished reading a poorly written & very boring book on the General Motors Building by Vicky Ward. Waste of time! @WileyBiz

The @nfl games are so boring now that actually, I’m glad I didn’t get the Bills. Boring games, too many flags, too soft!

Even though I refused to pay a ridiculous price for the Buffalo Bills, I would have produced a winner. Now that won’t happen.

I will be on Fox & Friends tomorrow morning at 7.00. Ebola and ISIS will be topics.

I don't know if President Obama isn't stopping the flights from Ebola torn West Africa because he is stubborn, stupid, or just doesn't care!

Here we go - A healthcare worker who treated Thomas Duncan, the man who flew into the U.S. from West Africa infected with Ebola, caught it!

President Obama, NOW, bring our 4000 innocent and ill-trained soldiers home from West Africa, before it is too late, AND STOP THE FLIGHTS!

Remember when I said when Saddam Hussein fell - the new leader of Iraq will be meaner and tougher and hate the U.S. even more. Welcome ISIS!

If a conservative Republican made the mistake that Mrs. Obama just made by calling Braley by the wrong name, it would be the biggest story!

Michelle Obama made a terrible mistake in Iowa. When endorsing Bruce Braley before a large crowd, she called him Bruce Bailey seven times.

Isn't it ridiculous, starting today, new Ebola screenings go into effect for people coming from West Africa. Just stop the flights dummies!

"I've never seen anything like it, everything he touches turns to gold!" So nice, a quote by Fred C.Trump about his son Donald (me!).

"@ray_chipendo: We are able to do certain things only because we do not know they are impossible. Donald Trump"

"@KangDedy_RI_1: @realDonaldTrump Donald, you are my best inspiration to be successful"

Do you notice that because of Ebola, ISIS etc., ObamaCare has gone to the back burner despite horrible results coming out. A disaster!

"@cgrubb85: If @realDonaldTrump doesn't run we are screwed #Trump2016 "

"@cgrubb85: @realDonaldTrump got my vote! Only one with common sense!" So true, thanks.

Obama: “I will control Ebola.” = Obama: “If you like your health care plan, you can keep your healthcare plan.”

Wow. @nfl ratings are down big league. Glad I didn't get the Bills. Rather be lucky than good.

The @nfl ratings continue to fall every week and will keep dropping. Boring games--too many flags--too soft!

The only reason I bid on @buffalobills was to make sure they stayed in Buffalo, where they belong. Mission accomplished.

"Obamacare puts poor people on a form of government run, single-payer health insurance that many doctors don't take" - @Avik

Obama is making the Ebola problem much worse than it needs to be in the U.S. by not halting flights from West Africa. Airport testing a joke

If you are interested in balancing work and pleasure, you will never succeed!

I feel sorry for the 4000 soldiers who are being forced to go the West Africa to fight Ebola. Their families are up in arms. Not trained.

Tens of millions of dollars in airstrikes had no impact because key leaders fled after hearing ON NEWS REPORTS the strikes were coming. DUMB

China is ripping wealth out Africa and yet, as usual, refuses to put anything back to help with Ebola. "Let the stupid Americans do it!" SAD

The residential real estate market continues to provide opportunities for first time home owners. Buy now if you can!

The CDC chief just said Ebola is spreading faster than Aids. Marines are preparing for a pandemic drill. Stop all flights from West Africa!

Obama won’t send troops to fight jihadists, yet sends them to Liberia to contract Ebola. He is a delusional failure.

Congratulations to @piersmorgan on his new position as Editor-at-Large for the United States of @MailOnline ! My Apprentice champ!

I have to admit @AlexSalmond is a tough, smart guy. He is formidable by any standard!

Right now 4000 U.S. troops are stupidly heading to West Africa to help fight Ebola.No help from China, Russia or wealthy African oil nations

“The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.” – Walt Disney

The U.S. is spending fortunes at airports checking people coming in from West Africa, with uncertain results. STOP THE FLIGHTS YOU DUMB B's!

In a little reported event, China has just overtaken the United States as the NUMBER ONE World economic power! Great going Washington!

Even Jimmy Carter just released a statement saying that Obama doesn't have a clue. That has to be a new low!

"@SMWalkerBait: @realDonaldTrump Please run for President..."

Obama, stop the flights to and from West Africa NOW - before it is too late! Can't you see what's happening? Can you be that thick (stupid)?

Can you believe this fool, Dr. Thomas Frieden of CDC, just stated, "anyone with fever should be asked if they have been in West Africa" DOPE

Any American who fights with ISIS should have their passport revoked. Take them to Gitmo for interrogation.

The fight against ISIS starts at our border. ‘At least’ 10 ISIS have been caught crossing the Mexico border. Build a wall!

China has just overtaken us as the world’s largest economy. We are busy wasting $'s while China builds airports & skyscrapers.

Entrepreneurs: See yourself as victorious. Look at the solution, not the problem.

“Today's put-off objectives reduce tomorrow's achievements.” - Henry Banks

ISIS is advancing even against Obama’s airstrikes. Obama is disengaged and making the Middle East even more dangerous.

Obamacare premiums continue to rise and bend up the cross curve. And the back-end of the website does not even work.

Obama is looking like an incompetent fool in the handling of the war against.ISIS! Why isn't China and Russia helping - they gain so much!

I was relentless because, more often than you would think, sheer persistence is the difference between success and failure. NEVER GIVE UP!

Real estate taxes are far too high @BriarcliffManor , Westchester. A total joke how they waste money! Replace Mayor Vescio.

Kentucky has a chance to have the Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, representing it in Washington. Big power for State. Don't blow it

I can't believe Mitch McConnell isn't way up in the Kentucky polls. Massive seniority brings so much power and status to State. Brings K.$'s

Despite the ever increasing Ebola disaster, Obama refuses to stop flights from West Africa.It's almost like he's saying F-you to U.S. public

Obama has missed 58% of his intelligence briefings. But our president does make 100% of his fundraisers.

I will be on On The Record @gretawire tonight at 7 PM

"@foxesden8: @realDonaldTrump Do you ever sleep! " Not too much!

I will be on Fox & Friends ( @foxandfriends ) at 7.00. Fighting Ebola will be a topic!

I'm not going to be watching much NFL football anymore. Too time consuming, too boring, too many flags and too soft. Focus on other things!

What the hell is Obama doing in allowing all of these potentially very sick people to continue entering the U.S.! Is he stupid or arrogant?

I don't know what it is, but I'm getting totally bored watching NFL football. Too many penalties and far too soft! T.V. off and back to work

The Jets just don't have it. Time for a quarterback change!

"@x_victoria97: @realDonaldTrump should be president.."

President Obama, I have an idea! Pretend that West Africa is Israel and then you will be able to stop the Ebola area flights.

President Obama - close down the flights from Ebola infected areas right now, before it is too late! What the hell is wrong with you?

Something very important, and indeed society changing, may come out of the Ebola epidemic that will be a very good thing: NO SHAKING HANDS!

This Ebola patient Thomas Duncan, who fraudulently entered the U.S. by signing false papers, is causing havoc. If he lives, prosecute!

If Ebola is so non-contagious, how come an NBC cameraman caught it so quickly while over in West Africa? U.S. is behaving very foolishly!

Can you believe that President Obama still hasn't stopped the flights and people pouring into the U.S. from West Africa. TERRIBLE PRESIDENT!

"@calfofgod: @realDonaldTrump you are the Smartest man in america. Why aren't you president. Who needs Obama? We need you! Please run!!"

@not_that_actor Wow Andy, such amazing writing and thought. Thank you!

Saw Michael Jordan and Ray Allen today playing golf at Trump National Doral, the Blue Monster. Great guys!

Ebola patient Duncan lied on his exit papers by saying he never came into contact with a person with Ebola. He knew he did, and person died.

How incompetent are our leaders allowing these Ebola infected people to come into our country with all of the problems and danger entailed!

The Ebola patient who came into our country knew exactly what he was doing. Came into contact with over 100 people.Here we go-I told you so!

The brand new hotel at Trump National Doral has the most beautiful rooms and suites in Miami. Enjoy!

I just arrived at Trump National Doral in Miami where I'll spend the day checking work just completed by contractors. This place is amazing!

Ebola is much easier to transmit than the CDC and government representatives are admitting. Spreading all over Africa-and fast. Stop flights

"@lynn4596: I seriously admire @realDonaldTrump , watching his show 'celebrity apprentice' was my inspiration to do well as a kid" Great.

We have millions in our country unemployed yet we are wasting millions arming Syrian ‘rebels.’ What is wrong with Washington?!

Obama can attend a fundraiser every day but can’t be bothered to get briefed on national security. Commander-in-Chief?!

Our national security starts at the border. Do you think ISIS & al-Qaeda are just in the Middle East?

" @RWDF1 @realDonaldTrump They are planning on building windturbines near Turnberry Golf course, on Knoweside hill" Not without a fight!

How is ABC Television allowed to have a show entitled "Blackish"? Can you imagine the furor of a show, "Whiteish"! Racism at highest level?

Stop flights into the U.S. from West Africa immediately!

The woman who is the Secret Service Director looks like she is way over her head.Why can't the president appoint the best and the brightest?

"@morgan_sux: Hey everyone! Just found an awesome Twitter account that you should check out!!! It's called @realDonaldTrump very cool"

"@brandotut: @realDonaldTrump calls a spade a spade, would be a breathe of fresh air in Washington."

The United States must immediately institute strong travel restrictions or Ebola will be all over the United States-a plague like no other!

How dumb is our president to send thousands of poorly trained and ill-equipped soldiers over to West Africa to fight Ebola. Stop all flights

Here we go! I stated long ago that we should cancel all flights from West Africa. Now we have Ebola in U.S., AND IT WILL ONLY GET WORSE!

President Obama should stay out of the Hong Kong protests, we have enough problems in our own country!Can't even properly police White House

"Success seems to be connected with action. Successful people keep moving. They make mistakes, but they don't quit." - Conrad Hilton

Fact--Obama does not read his intelligence briefings nor does he get briefed in person by the CIA or DOD. Too busy I guess!

Keep your momentum. Without momentum, a lot of great ideas go nowhere.

I've realized that success requires 100% effort and 100% focus. Nothing less. Get out there and go for it.

"@__________IAN: I saw Donald Trump on Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous when I was 4.That man must of had a drink ->fountain of youth.

It wasn't only that Obama saluted a Marine with a cup of coffee in his hand, but why the hell does he have to exit a heli holding coffee?

“Always bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed is more important than any other.” – Abraham Lincoln

Our country has become so politically correct that it has lost all sense of direction or purpose. We are unable to move forward painlessly.

"Without passion, you don’t have energy, and without energy, you have nothing!" Just one more of my totally brilliant quotes - use it well.

The NFL should have its non-profit status immediately revoked while at the same time ending the giant tax scam which makes teams so valuable

"@kylegolfmtnbike: @realDonaldTrump NFL is forever changed and I'm afraid in ten years it will be gone or flag football"

The NFL image is really tarnished! Now, if the sponsors start leaving and the ratings go down, the NFL will be in big trouble. Boring games!

They just called this the biggest scandal in U.S. sports history (GMA). Roger looks really weak and indecisive, must put on a better front!

What separates the winners from the losers is how a person reacts to each new twist of fate.

Do you believe that Obama is giving weapons to "moderate rebels" in Syria.Isn't sure who they are. What the hell is he doing.Will turn on us

Why are we sending thousands of ill-trained soldiers into Ebola infested areas of Africa! Bring the plague back to U.S.? Obama is so stupid.

Roger Goodell must stop apologizing to everyone who will listen and toughen up. His street smart players are laughing at him and the NFL!

“Sometimes you have to take a half step back to take two forward.” - @VinceMcMahon

The Iraqi army has squandered the majority of the weapons & training we gave them for 10 long years. When will we learn?

So Obama wants to bomb ISIS in Iraq & arm them in Syria? What is he doing!

Are the Republicans going to blow their chance to take the Senate? Must focus on ObamaCare and amnesty.

In order to stop the Ebola outbreak in Africa, perhaps the President should put all Africans on ObamaCare rather than sending the troops!

“Success is having to worry about every damn thing in the world, except money.” - Johnny Cash

We must immediately stop all air traffic coming from the Ebola infected areas of Africa—before it is too late.

Entrepreneurs: Believe in yourself. If you don't, no one else will either.

I've realized that success requires 100% effort and 100% focus. Nothing less.

Does anybody notice that Atlantic City lost its magic after I left years ago. I had the big boxing, introduced UFC (ask Dana),the best shows

Can you believe that the U.S. will be sending 3000 troops to Africa to help with Ebola.They will come home infected? We have enough problems

It is so sad to see what has happened to Atlantic City. So many bad decisions by the pols over the years - airport, convention center, etc.

I left Atlantic City years ago, good timing. Now I may buy back in, at much lower price, to save Plaza & Taj. They were run badly by funds!

If you can’t focus with unyielding resolve, then you will never be successful. Believe in yourself and you can accomplish your goals.

“Don't expect to build up the weak by pulling down the strong.” - Calvin Coolidge

Congratulations to Obama on building a strong economy. There are 49,500,000 people on food stamps. A historic record!

Obama’s promise to build an international coalition against ISIS is already broken. No one trusts him at home or abroad.

Good luck to the people of Scotland, whatever their decision may be on Thursday. The whole world is watching—really exciting!

I will be on Fox and Friends at.7.00 A.M. Enjoy!

"@MikeyJFitz: @realDonaldTrump Thru rough times 1 thing that keeps me going, I wasn't one of the idiots that voted for Obama. #Trump2016 "

I have nothing to do with Atlantic City-sold years ago (great timing). For losers and haters, I NEVER went bankrupt. Plus $10 billion, sorry

Money was never a big motivation for me, except as a way to keep score. The real excitement is playing the game!

Secretary Kerry cannot get other nations to join us in fighting ISIS. They are afraid and he is a poor salesman who reps a pathetic leader!

Sen. Kay Hagan voted for Amnesty & ObamaCare. She is a proven liberal who recklessly goes along with Obama. Vote @ThomTillis in November!

The so-called ‘moderate’ Syrian rebels pledged their allegiance to ISIS after Obama’s address. We should not be arming them!

The judge in the Oscar Pistorious case is a total moron. She said he didn't act like a killer. This is another O.J. disaster!

On 9/11, we pray for the victims and their families of the attack and give thanks to all who have sacrificed for justice & our freedom.

"@Yankee_RangerNV The silver lining in you not buying the Bills is that you can HOPEFULLY rescue what's left of this country& RUN!" So true!

They should have rebuilt the two buildings of the World Trade Center exactly as they were, except taller and stronger. A better statement!

I can't believe that the judge in the Oscar Pistorious case has found him not guilty of murder. No one has been more guilty since O.J.!

Can you believe that our very stupid politicians released the leader of ISIS and now we are spending billions trying to get him back!

"@therachelgibson: Seriously there is nobody who can fix this country but you. It's now or never! We need you. #USA #nowornever " So true!

"@kevinb____: @realDonaldTrump Saudi Arabia is already paying ISIS"

Tell Saudi Arabia and others that we want (demand!) free oil for the next ten years or we will not protect their private Boeing 747s.Pay up!

Middle Eastern countries must participate militarily (no running away) and big league financially in order for us to go in and save them!

I just want to know how much is Saudi Arabia and others who we are helping willing to pay for our saving from total extinction. Pay up now!

If Obama resigns from office NOW, thereby doing a great service to the country—I will give him free lifetime golf at any one of my courses!

I made a great deal of money in Atlantic City, but left years ago when I saw so many political mistakes being made. I have ZERO involvement!

Joan Rivers had great talent, but also truly amazing stamina and drive - she would never give up or quit. That is why she became a champion!

I'm not saying to not give vaccines, I am just saying give them small doses over a long period of time - not one massive dose for a child.

The ObamaCare website was hacked. $5B dollars later and the site can’t even secure your personal information.

China continues to be on the move both technologically and militarily. Obama is sitting by and watching.

Emmy Awards show was terrible last night. Same shows winning over and over again (politics). Amazing race a joke. Host Seth Meyers bombed!

"He who demands little gets it." - Ellen Glasgow

. @SenScottBrown is the most competitive GOP option against Obama’s amnesty loving @SenatorSheehan . He can win!

Obama sent weapons through Benghazi to ISIS yet he is holding up shipments to Israel. What is he thinking?

Obama’s motto: If I don’t go on tax payer funded vacations & constantly fundraise then the terrorists win.

Once the ISIS thug who beheaded Foley is identified 100%, he should be bunker busted to hell.

We will now be helping Syria and Iran by attacking ISIS - ironic, isn't it!

That Seth Meyers is hosting the Emmy Awards is a total joke. He is very awkward with almost no talent. Marbles in his mouth!

Our government now imports illegal immigrants and deadly diseases. Our leaders are inept.

So many people are agreeing with me on not creating a "highway" for Ebola to the U.S. Started in small area of Africa and now spreading fast

The bigger problem with Ebola is all of the people coming into the U.S. from West Africa who may be infected with the disease. STOP FLIGHTS!

A doctor on NBC Nightly News agreed with me-we should not bring Ebola into our country through two patients, but should bring docs to them.

Achievers move forward at all times. Achievement is not a plateau, it's a beginning.

Focus on your goals, not your problems. Don't tread water. Get out there and go for it.

We should have taken the oil in Iraq, and now our mortal enemies have got it, and with no opposition. Really dumb U.S. pols! I'm so angry!

Isis terror group has now fully taken over large sections of Iraq, and will soon have control of massive oil reserves. I told you so.

. @FrankLuntz works really hard but is a guy who just doesn't have it - a total loser!

The fact that we are taking the Ebola patients, while others from the area are fleeing to the United States, is absolutely CRAZY-Stupid pols

So many lives and two trillion dollars wasted, and our worst enemies will get the 2nd largest oil reserves in the World. Such stupid leaders

Just as I have been predicting for years, Iraq will fall to the people that hate the U.S. the most - just outside of Baghdad."Keep the oil"

The U.S. cannot allow EBOLA infected people back. People that go to far away places to help out are great-but must suffer the consequences!

When in doubt, Obama fundraises. He has held 393 fundraisers in six years. Another record.

Youth unemployment is at a record high. ObamaCare is a job destroyer which is ruining aspiring careers. It must be repealed.

Watch – Obama will not fix the illegal immigrant loophole. Instead he will sign another executive action giving more amnesty.

On June 1st. near Washington, D.C., I will be opening the greatest championship golf course in the U.S. All holes front on the Potomac River

Rosie is crude, rude, obnoxious and dumb - other than that I like her very much!

Rosie is back on the View which tells you how desperate they must be. It is the standard short term fix and long term disaster.

"@TBuffT: @TheNickSutton @theviewtv Hearing Rosie's name makes me nauseous! Seeing her face makes me puke! Cant imagine WATCHING her!"

Mexico is allowing many thousands to go thru their country & to our very stupid open door. The Mexicans are laughing at us as buses pass by.

When will the U.S. stop sending $'s to our enemies, i.e. Mexico and others.

" @TheNickSutton How does @realDonaldTrump feel about Rosie back at @theviewtv ?" They are desperate--a short term fix!

" @kyleraccio @realDonaldTrump thank you for fighting for our marine!" You're welcome.

" @Welles19 2016 = too late. America won't survive another 12 months of this lawless O regime & @gop cowards." That's what comebacks r about.

USMC Sgt. Tahmooressi sacrificed for our country. While Obama is welcoming illegals, our Marine is locked in a Mexican jail. #FreeOurMarine

" @JeniferStevens @danarigdon Every Trump property I've seen or played including courses and hotels redefines perfection" Great, thank you.

Our gov’t should immediately stop sending $’s to Mexico, no friend, until they release Marine & stop allowing immigrant inflow into U.S.

. @AlexSalmond I hope you played well at Royal Aberdeen but u must admit the windmill hovering over hole 14 is disgusting & inappropriate.

“As you go through life, you've got to see the valleys as well as the peaks.” – Neil Young

There is only one person who should be crossing our southern border, USMC Sgt. Tahmooressi. Boycott Mexico? #FreeOurMarine

We should cut off all aid to every country that does not respect our border. Why are we giving them money in the first place?

If only the illegals were Tea Party members then Obama would get them out of the country immediately.

I know Shia LaBeouf @thecampaignbook and when sober, a really nice guy. Must get act together fast before too late.

I just arrived in Barcelona. I make a big speech tomorrow and then off to Ireland and Scotland.

Practice positive thinking--this will keep you focused while weeding out anything that is unnecessary, negative or detrimental.

Realize that persistence can go a long way. Being stubborn is often an attribute.

Success requires 100% effort and 100% focus. Nothing less.

Control your own destiny or someone else will. -- Jack Welch

Our Q1 GDP was -2.9%. Worst in memory -- ObamaCare killing jobs, stopping growth and making small business insecure.

I'm leaving now for Ireland, Spain, Scotland and elsewhere--crazy life!

After these spirited primaries are over, @GOP must be fully united for November. If we take the Senate, we stop Obama’s agenda.

Someone just wrote that “you predicted every single major event that’s now happening—and they knock you instead of giving you credit.”

As Iran began the process of taking over Iraq, many people wanted me to say that “I told you so!” – so, I told you so.

…In other words, Secy John Kerry is so out of his element…

Secy John Kerry has a tough job but he looks so totally lost negotiating w/ those characters who are cleaning his clock. Sad to watch...

Eli Wallach was a great actor and a great guy. My opinion-- his performance in The Good the Bad and the Ugly was his all time best!

I look forward to my press conference on Weds of next week @TrumpTurnberry to discuss changes & big investment I'll make. Very exciting!

“Failures are expected by losers, ignored by winners.” -- @CoachJoeGibbs

It’s Thursday. Which brand of eyeliner is the nation’s worst AG @AGSchneiderman wearing today?

If you entered our country illegally and are then granted amnesty, why would you abide by other laws? No Amnesty!

Now Syria is bombing Iraq and Secy. Kerry, after we blew the hell out of the place, says please don't do that. Syria is a front for Iran.

Boycott Mexico until they release our Marine. With all the money they get from the U.S., this should be an easy one. NO RESPECT!

The 9.11.12 attack on the Benghazi consulate was a sophisticated, multi-prong wave attack. When will all the 50+ fighters face justice?

The Benghazi terrorist is getting speedier care than our Vets at the VA. Obama has his priorities.

A @senatormcdaniel win is a victory for our country. Chris is a Constitutional Conservative who'll make a difference in Washington.

The failing @NYDailyNews which just raised its prices because it’s dying, said I wear a “wig” when they know I don’t. Dishonest.

The dying @NYDailyNews asked me to do an Editorial on the Central Park 5 ripoff & then they pretend it was my idea. Loser newspaper!

I wonder if when Secy. Kerry goes to Iraq and Afghanistan he pushes hard for them to look at GLOBAL WARMING and study the carbon footprint?

Do you believe that Secy. KERRY just went to Egypt to talk about "human rights problems" and this as everything is being blown up around him

I'd bet the lawyers for the Central Park 5 are laughing at the stupidity of N.Y.C. when there was such a strong case against their "clients"

How much money are the lawyers for the Central Park Five getting out of the 40 million dollars, or are they paid by the City (or both)?

N.Y. City is paying FORTY MILLION DOLLARS to five men that many think are guilty as hell. So many facts - should have been trial. Politics!

"@BROONEYBROONEY: @realDonaldTrump love your thoughts and opinions on the Central Park 5!

Manufacturing is now less than 9% of US GDP. The Rust Belt, heart of our country’s factory sector, has been destroyed by our leaders.

What took so long to catch only 1 of the Benghazi terrorists? Especially after the killer has been taunting the US in the press f/2 yrs.

US Army Reserve @leezeldin will bring Conservative solutions to DC. Next Tuesday, vote for Lee in the NY-1 primary. #zeldinforcongress

Will the Benghazi terrorist use the videotape as a defense? If so, will Obama apologize to him?

A country that cannot protect its borders is a country destined to fail. Another broken promise by our leaders in Washington.

Congratulations to @spurs on their @NBA championship. Well-deserved.

If anybody else but Coore and Crenshaw designed Pinehurst they would be run out of town—(and the turtleback greens are totally unfair)!

The only reason I am critical of the Pinehurst look is because I’m a lover of golf—and that look on TV hurts golf badly.

" @welsh @realDonaldTrump you have made some great courses, but dont think that gives you the right to comment on every golf course! I agree!

@MattGinellaGC Matt, how many club championships have you won? I hear zero, or 18 fewer than me! Lets play for a lot?

" @ic @MattGinellaGC stick to media like everyone else in it with worthless opinions. DonaldTrump is 10,000 times more successful than you."

@MattGinellaGC Matt, you know nothing about quality golf or what it takes to make golf successful. You are all talk, no substance!

@MattGinellaGCSadly Matt, you don't understand golf (even though you think you do).I have numerous couses that are far superior to Pinehurst

@MattGinellaGC I have watched Open Championships at Turnberry, one of the great golf courses of the World. Pinehurst not in the same league

@MattGinellaGC My position on Pinehurst is correct - bad for the game, a dried out cow pasture. You have no clue but keep trying!

Johnny Miller correctly very critical of greens at Pinehurst. Said they should be "redone"

I'd bet the horrible look of Pinehurst translates into poor television ratings. This is not what golf is about!

@GolfDigestMag Big news from Scotland on Turnberry (which, by the way, blows Pinehurst away!) tomorrow morning. Stay tuned.

@GolfDigestMag Never in the history of televised golf has a course looked so bad and unattractive. A dry, burnt out mess! Bad for golf.

"@ChristianL2499: @realDonaldTrump You're the man Mr. Trump! #DonaldTrump2016 " Thanks.

. @MattGinellaGC Have you ever seen Trump National/Bedminster or Trump International Golf links in Scotland. Both far better than Pinehurst!

. @MattGinellaGC Matt, the statement about Pinehurst looking like a local community golf course,"awful", was not made by me but tweeted to me

. @MattGinellaGC It's true Matt, the NEW "Blue Monster" is better than Pinehurst, so is Bedminster. Turnberry & Trump Aberdeen blow it away!

I have been very consistent and always said that Iraq would fall as soon as the U.S. left. What a terrible waste of lives and money!

Iran will convince our incompetent President that they are trying to help us with Iraq, take over the country & oil, and "O" will say thanks

Turnberry in Scotland is a far superior golf course to Pinehurst - and it isn't even close! Likewise the Blue Monster at Doral.

Iran is moving troops into Iraq under the guise that it is helping out. Actually, they will take over Iraq and all of their oil. Stupid U.S.

"@Minnesotavk81: @realDonaldTrump your sign on chicago tower looks awesome!" Thanks.

The Iraqi Army is useless. President Obama, stay the hell out of Iraq (we should never have been there in the first place).

We should never have gone into Iraq but, once in, should have gotten out a lot faster. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

" @jamesbregenzer @TrumpChicago was completed during recession, when most other projects failed. Trump deserves Chicago's praise" @BlairKamin

Dopey @chicagotribune critic fails to mention the ugly Sun Times sign.

Before I bought the site, the Sun Times had the biggest, ugliest sign Chicago has ever seen. Mine is magnificent and popular.

" @lifesanthem @TrumpVancouver Good news. 1 of the most exciting people coming to 1 of the most exciting cities in the world!" A great place!

"@dreamsoles1 @realDonaldTrump you sir are a true inspiration to me I thank you." Great, thanks.

" @GOOD_ggg @TrumpGolf With GOOD service at his clubs imagine the service Mr Trump could give American people as Pres!" True!

" @ep_capital @ReformedBroker @PhilipRucker @realDonaldTrump yo that sign gonna be more famous than HOLLYWOOD!" I agree!

In answer to your questions about my favorite impersonator, the answer is Darrell Hammond.

People are LOVING the Trump sign on the Chicago building. Big league tweets, letters and calls…

A third rate architecture critic--who I thought got fired—for the failing @chicagotribune likes the building but doesn’t like the Trump sign

I told all of the haters and losers long ago that Iraq would fall, take the OIL or get out fast! Massive waste of lives and trillions of $'s

Iraq told us to get out, Iraq is now falling, and Iraq now wants us to come back! Don't do it unless we get the OIL, and I mean ALL OF IT!

Iraq is falling apart fast - two trillion dollars and so many deaths - Bush got us in and Obama took far too long to get us out!

BTW The Miss USA pageant was the highest rated non-sports telecast on the Big 4 networks. Congrats to our newly crowned @Nia_Sanchez_ !

The @GOP primary voter spoke last night in VA-7 & @DaveBratVA7th won going away. Now the party MUST stand behind him! Unity Unity Unity!

Congratulations to @BretBaier on the immediate & tremendous success of his book ‘Special Heart.’ Already in its third printing!

"@SMarkelon: Get this liar out of the White House. @realDonaldTrump for president 2016! He has the drive and business leadership we need!"

"@MissCassie1230: @realDonaldTrump for President! Smarter than any man in the USA!" I agree, thanks!

Iraq is far worse and of more danger to the U.S. now than it ever was under Saddam Hussein - and this after $2 trillion and so many lives!

" @Retrogirl01 He sure has my vote! It's time we get someone in there that has a brain! A business mind to clean this mess up! Thank you!

Eric Cantor's concession speech was ridiculous - acted like nothing had just happened. WE NEED REAL LEADERS!

"@AlexDavisChevy: Next pres. election is the first ill be old enough to vote in. Would vote for you in a heartbeat! #TrumpEm #Trump4Prez "

"@justalmir: @realDonaldTrump please run for election so my first ever vote could be for you!" Thanks!

As I have said, the Tea Party is alive and well and fighting hard for the USA. BIG WIN TODAY!

Tea Party takes down Eric Cantor - REALLY BIG WIN!

What I am saying is that we never should have been in Iraq in the first place. Bush was terrible, Obama is worse! Make America GREAT again.

I told you so a long time ago: Iraq just lost second largest city as their soldiers drop their guns and run. Only the beginning! OIL.

" @FilmBatonRouge Loved having @realDonaldTrump in town over the weekend for #MissUSA A beautiful city filled with beautiful girls" Thanks

" @mmurph @realDonaldTrump trump for president. You are a very wise man that we need in office!" Thank you.

"@MarcoGio13 Been listening to @realDonaldTrump speak words of wisdom on YouTube every night. He really needs to be our next president" Thx

" @mkathleenhunter Donald, that's a wonderful picture of you and your Dad. You can sense his love and pride in you!" Thank you.

"@Yzaccount @realDonaldTrump Your Dad for sure has a son to be proud of....We all are:)" So nice, thanks!

" @GamezFrank @realDonaldTrump when do you sleep?" Not much sleep for me!

Heading over to the Miss USA Pageant. The young women participating are amazing and accomplished. Competition is very tough. ENJOY THE SHOW!

The man made "climate change" that our "great" president should be focused on is of the NUCLEAR variety brought upon us because of weakness!

The Miss U.S.A. pageant will be amazing tonight. To be politically incorrect, the girls (women) are REALLY BEAUTIFUL. NBC at 8 PM.

No president in history has lied to the American people more than President Obama - in fact, it is not even close!

REMEMBER, the terrible 5 for 1 trade whereby the Taliban got back leaders (killers) and we got back a NOTHING, WILL COME BACK TO HAUNT U.S.!

The same "brilliant" negotiators that gave up five Taliban leaders for one traitor are now making trade deals with China & others.No chance

"@BAMA_K1NG: @realDonaldTrump and for some reason our government seems okay with that. #pleaserun2016 "

We have to make the U.S.A. RICH again so that we can afford to pay Social Security, Medicare,and Medicaid and STRONG to keep our enemies out

By the end of this year China will be the number one economic power on earth and the U.S. will owe 20 trillion dollars, much of it to China!

Just toured Baton Rouge, Louisiana - GREAT PEOPLE, fantastic place, doing really well. Miss USA Pageant totally sold out.Tomorrow night, NBC

I am in Baton Rouge where the Miss USA Pageant will be shown live on NBC on Sunday night for 3 hours starting at 8 P.M. INCREDIBLE SHOW!

The owner of California Gold just made a jerk (fool) out of himself. Just smile and congrat the winner. His wife was visibly embarrassed!

. @AndrewKreig Thank you Andrew - so correct!

Will be in Louisiana for the Miss USA Pageant which will be on NBC on Sunday night. Watch Miss Pennsylvania,an interesting and amazing story

Negotiation tip #1: The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it. - @realDonaldTrump "

Obama is, without question, the WORST EVER president. I predict he will now do something really bad and totally stupid to show manhood!

BREAKING NEWS: Obama has just made a trade with Russia. They get Florida, California & our gold supply. We get borscht & a bottle of vodka.

" @GleisisSantos Reading @realDonaldTrump 's Think Like a Champion . What a great and inspirational book." Thanks, good luck!

"@Ry_Ceo: @realDonaldTrump i always tell people to vote for Donald Trump if he runs for president. He knows the real deal!"

"@Boycottmaypac: @realDonaldTrump He got the president to show his Birth Certificate! He has clout my friend! He can really stir things up!"

I believe that in addition to the 5 terrorist leaders President Obama gave up for Bergdahl, a great deal of CASH was also given. So stupid!

. @bretbaier has a wonderful new book #specialheart and it’s proving to be a great success already. Bret is a winner!

Congratulations to @joniernst on her impressive @IowaGOP primary win last night. Now all should unite & defeat Bruce Braley this November

" @fear_no_evil89 @realDonaldTrump is not afraid to tell the truth & stand up for what he thinks is right #GOP2016 #Trump2016 " Thank you

" @iCheko_LOM All Mr. @realDonaldTrump is trying to do is wake everyone up to the truth. Loving the tweets." Thank you.

"@MikeyGojca @realDonaldtrump speaks the truth and is as successful as he is... must be doing something right." I guess so, thanks!

"@_lizzly Nearly anything would be more effective than Obama. @realDonaldTrump is the ideal candidate for this country's restoration" Thx.

Obama can release 5 senior Taliban for a deserter but can’t make Mexico release decorated Marine Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi. Pathetic

Obama betrays Israel yet again, our strongest ally in the Middle East. He will recognize Hamas, breaking long standing US policy.

Chris McDaniel looks like he will win in Mississippi - GREAT NEWS and big victory for Tea Party!

Obama never consulted with Congress about a prisoner exchange. HE BROKE THE LAW AND SHOULD BE TRIED. OUR PRESIDENT IS A TOTAL DISASTER!

Are you allowed to impeach a president for gross incompetence?

Was Susan Rice told to lie about Bergdahl? Obama and his representatives lie about virtually everything, from ObamaCare to a deserter.

. @newsbusters Thank you for a great and very accurate story - well done!

Rapidly failing @VanityFair magazine hits me for my strong stance against Obama's "brilliant" 5 killers for 1 deserter trade. Amazing!

The five Taliban leaders released for a deserter must really be laughing and having a good time right now. They are saying how dumb U.S. is!

Our President is a great embarrassment to the U.S. How could anybody be so dumb or know so little as to make the very stupid 5 for 1 swap?

It would be nice if our commander-in-chief was as concerned for our Veterans health as he is for illegal immigrants becoming citizens.

Moving forward f/tonight’s competitive primaries, it is crucial that the Tea Party & @GOP remain united towards November. Take the Senate!

" @LisaV27 @realDonaldTrump I want you Mr. Trump as the president" Well, we'd better get someone fast--the U.S. is going down--fast.

“It's a tough game, and you never want to take that aspect out of the game.” – @NYRangers Stanley Cup Champion Mark Messier

Obama’s war on coal is killing American jobs, making us more energy dependent on our enemies & creating a great business disadvantage.

Be sure to buy this month’s @AmSpec magazine. Read “A Trump Card,” my interview with Jeffrey Lord.

Because of our terrible leaders, it is now open season on every American throughout the world. Terrorists are thrilled.

President said we would never leave a soldier behind. How about the 4 who died in Benghazi?

Great deal, we swap 5 killer terrorists for a U.S. military deserter. That’s how the U.S. negotiates nowadays.

" @Taylor_McBath Obama is actively destroying the greatest country in the world. We are going to pay a horrible price for his recent actions"

Bowe Bergdahl walked off the base after he was told not to. Solders died looking for him. U.S. should NEVER have made the deal! PUNISHMENT?

Only a grossly incompetent government led by an equally incompetent president could have made the terrible trade for Bergdahl. #OrangeRoom

That the Obama administration didn't know the facts about who Bergdahl was before making the stupid 5 killers for one trade is pathetic!

"@MrCurvyWor @realDonaldTrump Enjoyed seeing you on @Letterman ! You should run for President! You would get this great country going again!"

Entrepreneurs: Keep your momentum going! It's a big factor in sustaining your success. Keep moving forward!

" @danmillman I give @realDonaldTrump a lot of shit, but Trump National in Bedminster is absolutely incredible." Thanks (sort of)!

"@_Brandoh: @realDonaldTrump Donald for President!" Thanks.

"@diverojalv: @TaynishaGray Trump boldy calls out problems,then offers solutions & opinions that excite the electorate, just like Reagan!"

" @mizatch @realDonaldTrump watching what you said on Tuesday on @cspan You make sense. I hope to continue to learn from you. Thank you sir!"

The statement about leaving the base came directly from CBS Evening News.

At some point Sgt. Bergdahl will have to explain his capture. In 2009 he simply wandered off his base without a weapon. Many questions!

"@kylegolfmtnbike: @realDonaldTrump wonder how long it takes the released terrorists to attack Americans?"

The U.S. cannot negotiate with terrorists. It is a sad and terrible situation for the family involved, but this can only lead to disaster.

President Obama created a VERY BAD precedent by handing over five Taliban prisoners in exchange for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. Another U.S. loss!

"@Versongoetrix: @realDonaldTrump If you run for president I will absolutely vote for you and so will my family/friends!~" Great!

"@druudruu: @realDonaldTrump worked there once. Stayed there too. It was a dream both times!"

"@87krusty87: @realDonaldTrump I saw the Toronto hotel last year - it is a beauty indeed! Great addition to the skyline!"

#TheArsenioHallShow Well, it had to happen. People that are disloyal, in the long run, never make it. Arsenio was just cancelled!

Our country is on the precipice. Washington is broken. Where is the leadership?

Our vets are the pride of our nation. The VA scandal is a disgrace.If you can get food stamps so fast, our vets should get immediate care

"@MANNYSTEEZU: @realDonaldTrump should run for president." Thank you!

. @McIlroyRory - Way to go Rory, fantastic victory!

Have a great and peaceful Memorial Day - but remember, there are people out there who don't want us to have peace. WE MUST BE STRONG!!!!

The Obama administration gives better medical care to Al Qaeda at Gitmo than to our vets.

The VA scandal shows the fatal ineptitude of big central planning government. When will we learn?

Remember our brave men & women who have fallen protecting our country this Memorial Day!

Very excited to be addressing the @RepLeadConf next Friday in New Orleans. There is much to discuss!

The ring announcers are working hard to justify the Mayweather victory. They should be ashamed of themselves! A TOTAL JOKE.

No wonder boxing is close to dead!

Crowd is booing the hell out of that phony decision - place is angry and going wild. Fight was not even close! DISGUSTING.

The Mayweather decision is a disgrace!

NO WAY, JUDGES SAY MAYWEATHER WON. INVESTIGATION SHOULD TAKE PLACE. FIX?

Fight is over - Mayweather lost big - but lets see what judges say!

Mayweather is getting absolutely killed!

Floyd Mayweather is being beaten up badly through 10 rounds by Marcos Maidana, but announcers say it is even. TWO ROUNDS LEFT.

The reporter that called Kevin Durant "Mr. Unreliable" should be fired or, at least, apologize. He is a truly great player and a winner!

There must be a higher standard of accuracy in the media. Incredible that some so-called "journalists" can make up lies and get away with it

" @salpie @realDonaldTrump and how many of the jobs report uptick is due to Feds hiring #Obamacare exchange temps!" Good question. ?

Does @VanityFair realize that the purpose of a magazine is to sell issues? Circulation at record low. Spy Mag also failed under Graydon.

Never make a concession during negotiations that could lead to more demands. Be prudent. It's best to have your concessions predetermined

Negotiations 101: The best deals you can make are the ones you walk away from...and then get them with better terms.

With @VanityFair circulation and advertising revenue doing so badly, rumor has it that dopey Graydon Carter is going to resign? He should.

China will now pass our economy this year, way ahead of projections. Pres. Obama – China’s greatest asset!

Dopey @ariannahuff should force her reporters to be accurate—if she has that power.

It’s important to listen to what people say. “Horrible” and “disgusting” are the words I used in response to Sterling’s comments.

It is also amazing how comments can be edited to provide statements that are used in a knowingly incorrect manner.

Major League Baseball was really smart when they wouldn't let Mark Cuban buy a team. Was it his financials or the fact that he's an asshole?

For China, of all nations, to search the massive Indian Ocean and pick up the ping from the black box of flight 370 sounds a bit far fetched

Entrepreneurs: Another question to ask yourself—“What am I pretending not to see?” There may be great opportunities right around you.

For Entrepreneurs: A good question to ask yourself –“What can I provide that does not yet exist?”

" @SamJabbo @realDonaldTrump i haven't read any of your books yet, which one should i start with?" The Art of the Deal is a good start.

"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts." -- Winston Churchill

"You have enemies? Good. That means you've stood up for something, sometime in your life." -- Winston Churchill

Some great quotes from the legendary and courageous Winston Churchill: "Never, never, never give up." ...

If you’ve looked over the years,I’ve been right on virtually every issue from Iraq (not going in but if so taking the oil) to jobs to China

By Obama mentioning Manhattan yesterday in his response, he has singlehandedly made it target #1. How totally stupid is this guy?

"@wesbart53: Watched his speech yesterday...pathetic. Carter-esque, weak. His delivery is so cautious not to offend, absolutely zero" True!

This is the time for the United States to be strengthening all important military components - not rolling over and dealing from weakness!

Not good or smart for Obama to be calling Russia a "regional" power or to mention the concept of a nuclear weapon going off in NYC.

President Obama looks absolutely exhausted in the Netherlands. He is not a natural leader, was never ment to lead - it is tough work for him

"He that is good for making excuses is seldom good for anything else." -- Benjamin Franklin

" @jeffraissle @realDonaldTrump When will #CelebrityApprentice be back? I miss TV's best reality show!" Very soon--shooting now!

Obama should stop running down the stairs when getting off Air Force One. Doesn’t look presidential and at some point he will take a fall.

I wonder if Apple is upset with me for hounding them to produce a large screen iPhone. I hear they will be doing it soon—long overdue.

Obama must now FOCUS, get his mind off "March.Madness", and LEAD! Watch Russia closely, work hard on the economy and get rid of ObamaCare!

The situation with Russia is much more dangerous than most people may think - and could lead to World War III. WE NEED GREAT LEADERSHIP FAST

We should be building up our military and our missile defense systems to their highest levels ever. Must be very strong to prosper & survive

I believe Putin will continue to re-build the Russian Empire. He has zero respect for Obama or the U.S.!

Putin has become a big hero in Russia with an all time high popularity. Obama, on the other hand, has fallen to his lowest ever numbers. SAD

Great advice from my mother: “Trust in God and be true to yourself.” – Mary MacLeod Trump

Great advice from my father: "Know everything you can about what you're doing." -- Fred C. Trump

"Continuous effort - not strength or intelligence - is the key to unlocking our potential." -- Winston Churchill

President Obama, be cool, be smart, be sharp and FOCUS (no more March Madness), and you can beat Putin at his own game. IT CAN BE DONE!

While Putin is scheming and beaming on how to take over the World, President Obama is watching March Madness (basketball)!

I don't hate Obama at all, I just think he is an absolutely terrible president, maybe the worst in our history!

We're spending a fortune looking for the lost plane with mostly Chinese passengers, and that's OK-but how much are Russia & China spending?

President Obama was able to fool the Americans by getting elected, but not able to fool Vladimir Putin. Too bad for us!

"@CheezitsCat: . @realDonaldTrump what is ur favorite plane?" Boeing 757 and Citation X.

Looks like plane may have been found in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Australia.

Lithium ion batteries should not be allowed to be used in aircraft. I won't fly on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner - it uses those batteries.

Plane was carrying those terrible lithium ion batteries, which are highly combustible, as cargo. Fire could have started in cockpit.

" @rickdavenport8 @TrumpDoral LOOKING FORWARD TO TAKING ON THE MONSTER SOON!!! SO WHAT IS THE DONALDS BEST ON IT?? EXCITING LOOKING COURSE!!"

The massive Blue Monster @TrumpDoral is getting rave reviews. I built it in one year—no easy feat!

I’ve been watching very little @CNBC lately—the good news is I’m switching over to @BloombergNews and @FoxNews .

Other worthy people were taken off the @CNBC list as well. Stupid poll should be canceled—no credibility.

The #CNBC 25 poll is a joke. I was in 9th place and taken off. (Politics?) No wonder @CNBC ratings are going down the tubes.

Congratulations to Patrick Reed for winning at Trump National Doral. He told me The Blue Monster is "the best course I've ever played"

Will be on Fox & Friends at 7 (10 minutes). ENJOY!

Leaders at Trump National Doral are only one under par. The great Ben Hogan said, "I've never seen a great course that was easy!"

The newly built Blue Monster at Trump National Doral is being considered a "masterpiece" by almost all who see it and play it - THANK YOU!

I’ll be at the Blue Monster at Trump National Doral all weekend watching the Cadillac World Championships. @TrumpDoral @CadillacChamp

I am at @TrumpDoral watching the Cadillac World Championships. The Blue Monster is playing tough against the world’s greatest golfers.

Congrats to @AlCardenasACU and @CPACnews . I really enjoyed being there—the response was so terrific!

@sashamajerovsky Thanks Sasha!

The unbiased reporters and attendees said mine was the best and most well received speech at CPAC - THANK YOU!

Actually I was very nice to Jimmy Carter during my standing room only (& standing ovation) speech for CPAC - stated better Pres. than Obama!

Of course I don't think Jimmy Carter is dead-saw him today on T.V. Just being sarcastic, but never thought he was alive as President, stiff!

Actually Putin doesn't want Alaska because the Environmental Protection Agency will make it impossible for him to drill for oil!

What do you think Obama will do when Putin seizes Alaska?

Baltimore just set a record for the coldest day in March in a long recorded history - 4 degrees. Other places likewise. Global warming con!

. @Mitt Romney strongly stated, in one of the debates with Pres. OBAMA, that Russia is the big problem. Obama scoffed. Mitt was 100% correct!

New York Magazine just named the most influential "tweeters" in N.Y. and one Donald Trump was #2 after ESPN. Actually, I'm easily #1!

"@KEEMSTARx: If @realDonaldTrump was president, middle class would make more $. I honestly think he could keep Jobs in America! So true-easy

. @JTimberlake It was great having you play The Blue Monster. Thanks for your nice statements-many agree that it is best they've seen!

Very exciting week for @TrumpDoral . I will be in Miami opening what will soon be best resort in U.S. World Golf Championship this week!

@TheEllenShow Ellen, you should get rid of Andy Lassner - the guy has absolutely no imagination or talent. Good try last night!

I have always liked Ellen, done her show numerous times, but she was not good last night - fumbling and stumbling!

Ellen was so awkward and insecure last night. The pizza skit was terrible. She should dump Andy Lassner, a guy with no absolutely no talent!

Sissy Graydon Carter of failing Vanity Fair Magazine and owner of bad food restaurants has a problem-his V.F. Oscar party is no longer "hot"

Will be playing golf today with Rand Paul at Trump International in Palm Beach. Will be both interesting and fun!

China has just intervened to lower the yuan- in other words, they will continue to screw the U.S.!

I'll be playing golf tomorrow in Palm Beach at the number one rated golf course in the State of Florida, Trump International Golf Club.

The World is falling apart around us, but we don't have people who know how to play the game. The U.S. is in big trouble - no leadership!

The U.S. has appealed ro Russia not to intervene in Ukraine - Russia tells U.S. they will not become involved, and then laughs loudly!

Obama just stated "he didn't take school seriously, made bad choices and GOT HIGH" - then how the hell did he get into Columbia & Harvard?

Lightweight @AGSchneiderman ’s phony lawsuit against Trump U was decimated by the court—he’s a loser!

Congrats to Charles @krauthammer for his statements on climate change, formerly known as global warming!

It's not climate change,it's global warming.Don't let the dollar sucking wiseguys change names midstream because the first name didn't work

Do you think John Kerry is aware of the fact that they are building nuclear weapons in Iran and North Korea and Pakistan already has them!!

Do you believe this one - Secretary of State John Kerry just stated that the most dangerous weapon of all today is climate change. Laughable

Don't let the GLOBAL WARMING wiseguys get away with changing the name to CLIMATE CHANGE because the FACTS do not let GW tag to work anymore!

Due to the holiday, I will NOT be doing Fox & Friends this morning. Next Monday at 7.

"@chrismashimbyi: The Art Of The Deal by @realDonaldTrump is one of the greatest books ever!" Thank you!

Remember when "comedian" Bill Maher openly praised the disgusting terrorists who destroyed the World Trade Center-then got canned by ABC?

Failing comedian Bill Maher, who I got an accidental glimpse of the other night, is really a dumb guy, just look at his past!

Once ObamaCare is fully enacted in NY, conveniently after 2014, expect higher premiums, bigger deductibles, & worse care. Job killer!

“The cheapest natural gas in the world is in the United States.” - @boonepickens

Always leave your ego at the door during negotiations. Remember, it’s only business and there will always be another day!

Welcome to the new reality! Moody’s just downgraded the entire US health insurance industry because of ObamaCare.

It was great being on @MikeAndMike in the Morning (ESPN)—two great guys, fantastic show!

Mike & Mike in one minute!

I will be on the Mike & Mike Show on radio and ESPN-at about 6 to 7 A.M. We will be talking Super Bowl and sports-no Obama Care!

Give me clean, beautiful and healthy air - not the same old climate change (global warming) bullshit! I am tired of hearing this nonsense.

The weather has been so cold for so long that the global warming HOAXSTERS were forced to change the name to climate change to keep $ flow!

Snowing in Texas and Louisiana, record setting freezing temperatures throughout the country and beyond. Global warming is an expensive hoax!

How much is New York State spending on that obnoxious T.V. commercial that is being played endlessly for a tax incentive that doesn't work?

Steve Jobs is spinning in his grave - Apple has lost both vision and momentum - must move fast to get magic back!

I predicted Apple's stock fall based on their dumb refusal to give the option of a larger iPhone screen like Samsung. I sold my Apple stock

Apple's iPhone sales fell way short-they must go to a larger screen, as alternative, fast (as I said long ago)! Samsung's size much better.

Everything comes to him who hustles while he waits. -- Thomas A. Edison

For entrepreneurs, ignorance is not bliss. It's fatal. It's costly. And it's for losers. You either get organized, or get crushed.

Passion gives great momentum and can be the catalyst for great achievement.

Give your goals substance. Imbue them with a value that exceeds the monetary. Make them count on as many levels as you can.

Afghanistan's so called leader, Karzai, is toying with the U.S.

Will be on Fox & Friends at 7.00 - Enjoy!

Do you really believe our once great country can continue to survive with incompetent leadership. The answer is no and we better move fast!

Any and all weather events are used by the GLOBAL WARMING HOAXSTERS to justify higher taxes to save our planet! They don't believe it $$$$!

NBC News just called it the great freeze - coldest weather in years. Is our country still spending money on the GLOBAL WARMING HOAX?

Have the right mindset for the job. See your work as an art form--which means paying attention to every detail.

When times are difficult, you must be even more focused. That’s when you will find profitable opportunities.

For all of those who have been asking, a big cast announcement coming soon for @ApprenticeNBC !

Set high standards and meet them. The proof is in the doing: learn by doing and taking risks.

Fox & Friends at 7.00

"@bbeltku: Named my first born son after @realDonaldTrump Hope he lives up to the name!" He will be a total winner!

"@Bigkick85: @realDonaldTrump A true inspiration for the American Dream" Thank you!

To be really successful it is always good to have A COOL HEAD, WARM HEART AND BEAUTIFUL COMMON TOUCH!

Wow, just heard that that next Tuesday’s @saintanselm Politics & Eggs is the largest crowd ever. Looking forward to making new friends.

@EdwardFCox and @RobAstorino , who I like, are intent on another New York State suicide mission. They've got to get their act together!

To get momentum, you must first focus on a specific goal with passion and intensity.

Trust your instincts. They are there for a reason. Without instincts, you'll have a hard time getting to--and staying at--the top.

“Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence wins championships.” - Michael Jordan

@NewYorkGOP leader Ed Cox’s record is abysmal--no victories. Hopefully he can turn things around.

Looking forward to being hosted by @saintanselm for Politics & Eggs next Tuesday. See you in Manchester! #NHPolitics

Lightweight @AGSchneiderman is fighting with @NYGovCuomo –Cuomo wins that one easily. Schneiderman is a total loser.

To be a winner, think like a winner. Practice positive thinking--with reality checks.

Department of Homeland Security has spent $3.5 billion dollars building their new headquarters and is years late and billions over budget!

I hope we never find life on another planet because if we do there's no doubt that the United States will start sending them money!

@tedbishop38pga Thanks Ted, see you at the show!

I would like to thank a great writer and person, @JPappasPR ., of REAL ESTATE WEEKLY, for the wonderful story on me. Very much appreciated!

Where is the progress in the state of New York over the last three years? There is none--only backwards.

The Senate should immediately vote on the Iranian sanctions bill. What is the delay? Iran is already breaking its agreement with Obama

Gabriel Sherman’s book on Roger Ailes is filled with falsehoods and inaccuracies. Publisher should be ashamed (and sued).

" @WLynton It's my 30th B Day today, and a reply from you would be the best gift ever?" Happy Birthday

" @tonyge0101 @realDonaldTrump why don't you buy your own team? You'll be the best owner ever!" Thanks.

" @1JeffHensley I'm a Yankee fan & I agree whole heartedly. He aint worth it never was . TRUMP 2016!" Great, thx.

"@OsamaBinBallinn: Out of all the "celebrities" @realDonaldTrump is the only one that speaks the truth. We need more leaders like him!

A-Rod’s lawsuit trying to overturn a binding arbitration agreement is going nowhere. He should be banned from spring training.

@NewYorkGOP The Ed Cox letter to Republicans, which is being so badly ridiculed by the press, should never have been written. WEAKNESS-SAD!

"@SpenceGarcia805: @realDonaldTrump is the man!! Huge inspiration" Thanks!

"@JacksBeach: @realDonaldTrump @jeffredman5 Trump's a strong leader. Letterman is a weak, passive, insecure person." Thanks, but he is good!

Watching Gates on @seanhannity - looks like he got hit by a truck! Why didn't Obama get him, and others,to sign a confidentiality agreement?

"@Michele_WV: @realDonaldTrump PLEASE RUN FOR PRESIDENT AND STRAIGHTEN THINGS OUT." There is plenty to straighten out!

"@haventravel: @realDonaldTrump you inspired me to be my own boss and start my own small business."

"@caleb2207: @realDonaldTrump my family is going to Hawaii & I told them to go to @TrumpWaikiki I told them that yours' are the best!"

@NewYorkGOP New York Republicans must change from a culture of losing to a culture of winning - and fast. This is your last decent shot!

Think positively. Zap negativity immediately. Focus on the solution, not the problem. Be persistent and alert--every single day. Momentum!

For great success, you need passion, but make sure it's well directed. Learn everything you can about what you're doing. Be an expert.

#1 for success: Find out what you love to do. Trust yourself enough to find out what is best for you and what you're best at doing...

Resilience is part of the survival of the fittest formula--make sure you remain adaptable.

@cmo626 long time admirer. Want to buy one of your books for a friend. Any suggestions?" The Art of the Deal is a good start.

"@CarolynGoltman It's my birthday and what a wonderful gift if I could get a retweet from such an inspirational man :-)" Happy Birthday

"@_cnolan: We need someone like or @realDonaldTrump himself for President in 2016!" Thank you!

Yankees should have dropped A-Rod long ago, not even bothered with arbitration. They would have saved a fortune!

"@D_Cash_honey: @realDonaldTrump I get my inspiration for what I do everyday from you." So nice, thanks!

Focus on your goals, not on fixed patterns. Do what's necessary and what's unnecessary will be made clear.

Understand that difficulties, mistakes & setbacks are an inevitable part of business and life. Don't allow them to knock you off your feet.

Anticipate change and embrace it. Recognize new developments that you can capitalize on and use to open new doors.

" @PIERPAOLOMONNI @realDonaldTrump @ArekRNBN Definitely a great book! Think like a Champion, to be a Champion!" Thanks.

After watching all about the horror story that is A-Rod, I realized again that it is time to let Pete Rose into the Baseball Hall of Fame!

"@YoSoyTuMarido_: Todos son culeros @realDonaldTrump FOR PRESIDENT!!!!! USA USA!"

@rodstowell73 They are all afraid to use it because they know what will happen - thanks!

The Republican Party of New York has been conditioned to lose, and there is no excuse for this. Leadership must move fast and decisively!

I will be doing Fox & Friends tomorrow morning at 7.00. Will be discussing all sorts of current disasters!

Whether you like Obama or not, Bob Gates turned out to be one disloyal dude! Personally, I hate rats.

"@chrisexpress5: Only @realDonaldTrump could help this country out of the hole it's in. #Trump2016 "

In politics, and sometimes in life, FRIENDS COME AND GO, BUT ENEMIES ACCUMULATE!

Now that the ObamaCare website contractor has been terminated for obvious incompetence, is the person who hired them going to be fired?

President Obama just fired the ObamaCare website builder. My question is, why were they hired in the first place? Sue them for damages!

The brand new Blue Monster just opened at Trump National Doral - Miami. Also, great new driving range which is open 'till midnight. GO SEE!

Focus on your goals, not your problems. Problems are a mind exercise--learn to play beyond your comfort zone.

Be tough, be smart, be personable, but don't take things personally. That's good business.

"_xx_justme I still can't believe Donald Trump responded to my tweet. "Respect" #Trump2016 He would be the best Pres for this Country." Thx

" @KentTucker planning a golf trip to Scotland Aug 2015 - should we plan on playing Trump Int'l??" Yes, it is the best.

It’s Thursday. How many people have lost their healthcare today?

The Trump Organization continues to expand internationally at a record pace. Many new announcements to come soon.

Thanks everybody for the Happy Birthday greetings, but it’s actually the 10th birthday of The Apprentice. My birthday is June 14th....

The news about our beautiful Miss Venezuela, Monica Spear, is devastating to all who knew her. A spectacular woman, she will be missed.

We had a GREAT year @Macys with ties, shirts and suits, thanks! New selections just arrived - they are amazing!

"@kevinrleyland: @realDonaldTrump Has it been more than you ever expected?" Far more and far better!

Tomorrow is the 10 year anniversary of the Apprentice, one of the biggest hits in television history. How time flies!

Why didn’t Gates resign if he was so unhappy about what he was being told by Obama? The fact is, Iraq etc. have always been disasters!

While I am a critic of President Obama, I hate it when someone (Robert Gates) writes a self serving negative book about his boss.

Please, @21Club , go back to your original menu and preparation. Believe me, it was much better. Let me know when the change is made!

Identify your goals. Know precisely what you want to achieve, study the best people in your field,and then plan the best route for success.

Remember to think big by expanding your horizons at the same time you're expanding your net worth.

Achievers move forward at all times. Don't tread water. Get out there and go for it.

" @EpilepsyS Will you or @EricTrump try to be president of the united states? You could be a great president." Thanks.

"@duffman263 Just realised @realDonaldTrump was in home alone 2! Looking dapper as always" Thank you.

" @RandDHenninger great quote! I'm in the turf business. Nj and Phil. Your sups and courses are top notch!" Thank you.

We are experiencing the coldest weather in more than two decades-most people never remember anything like this. GLOBAL WARMING anyone?

Have your own vision & stick with it. Don't be afraid to be unique.Every day is an opportunity to show what you can do at the highest level.

Entrepreneurs: Set the example and you'll be a magnet for the right people. Great leaders determine the teams they assemble.

Sec of State Kerry said we would not go back to Iraq. We shouldn’t, but he should not have said that. So stupid!

Another one of my predictions just came true-- Iraq is a total disaster with government losing all control—so sad.

" @Drake4444444 the only way to fix health care crisis is for you to run for Pres & bring common sense back to govt" Thx.

" @jorgekb @TrumpDoral Blue Monster should be top 10 best courses this year!! Amazing course layout !! " Thank you.

“The future is always beginning now.” - Mark Strand, former Poet Laureate

Record snowfall & freezing temps throughout the country. Where is Global Warming when you need it?!

Try to develop a tempo when you're working--momentum is something you have to work at to maintain, & is an important element of success.

A regular part of your day should be devoted to expanding your horizons. Learning is a new beginning.

Snowden should come back to America and face justice. Instead, he is begging for clemency from Moscow. Treat him as a spy.

It's Jan. 2. President Obama should end his vacation early & get back to Washington to straighten out the ObamaCare catastrophe--or end it.

"Thinking big is the driving force that has forged all the great achievements in modern life." - Think Big

Entrepreneurs are visionaries in some respects--they look beyond the present. Keep that in mind when looking for opportunities.

Make sure to have fun and celebrate NYE with friends and family. Happy New Year everyone!

“Tomorrow is the first blank page of a 365-page book. Write a good one.” — @BradPaisley

Spend your last day of 2013 contemplating the moves you will make in 2014 to make it your best year ever!

The con artists changed the name from GLOBAL WARMING to CLIMATE CHANGE when GLOBAL WARMING was no longer working and credibility was lost!

What the hell is going on with GLOBAL WARMING. The planet is freezing, the ice is building and the G.W. scientists are stuck-a total con job

Congratulations to @woodyjohnson4 and @nyjets on yesterday's very exciting game.

Cover your bases--know everything you can about what you're doing. Keep your focus by being well informed on a daily basis.

Ask yourself, "Is this a blip or is it a catastrophe?" and your equilibrium will be kept in check if/when hard times hit.

Be tough, be focused. There are a lot of ups and downs, but you can ride them out if you're prepared for them.

Temperature at record lows in many parts of the country. 50 degrees below zero with wind chill in large area. Global warming folks iced in!

In the upcoming New Year we will focus like never before - if we do that we will have complete and total VICTORY in all we do!

We're coming up on the NEW YEAR-It is really important that, despite so many stupid decisions being made in Washington, we make it BEST EVER

The global warming scientists don't want to be airlifted off the ship-they are having too much fun and that is too simple a solution-FAME!

We should be focused on clean and beautiful air-not expensive and business closing GLOBAL WARMING-a total hoax!

The rescue icebreaker, trying to free the ship of the GLOBAL WARMING scientists, has turned back-the ice is massive (a record). IRONIC!

Will be working with contractors at Trump National Doral in Miami today.

@ProudlySA As a major fan of Nelson Mandela and the people of South Africa, all of my statements are made with love. Protect his legacy now

I hope everybody is having a FANTASTIC Christmas! No matter how tough things may seem remember that you will ride it out & go on to victory!

The new Pope is a humble man, very much like me, which probably explains why I like him so much!

Entrepreneurs: Put everything you've got into what you're doing. Be totally focused--nothing should be haphazard.

Entrepreneurs: Whatever happens, you're responsible. If it doesn't happen, you're responsible.

ALWAYS TRY TO LEARN FROM OTHER PEOPLES MISTAKES, NOT YOUR OWN - IT IS MUCH CHEAPER THAT WAY!

SOMETIMES YOUR BEST INVESTMENTS ARE THE ONES YOU DON'T MAKE!

Did you ever not do something that had you done it would have turned out to be a disaster. Never look back, just learn from your experience!

Realize that being an entrepreneur is not a group effort. You're in charge--everything starts with you.

Entrepreneurs: Be ready for problems--you'll have them every day. Keep open to new ideas--that's where innovation begins.

@TSeay18 Find work that you love--you have to be passionate about it to succeed. Then focus and never give up!

" @ZootmanTom @realDonaldTrump love your words of wisdom. Merry Christmas & happy new year" Thanks.

" @BigBobLarsen I don't always agree with you but I must say you do know how to inspire..." Thank you.

#3. Look at the solution, not the problem. Learn to focus on what will give results.

#2. Keep your momentum. Without momentum, a lot of great ideas go nowhere.

#1. Keep the big picture in mind. There are always opportunities and possibilities, and thinking too small can negate a lot of them.

"@CitizenZeroLand: @realDonaldTrump Yo, bro, you rock! Fo real." Very cool, thanks!

With the very dangerous carjacking epidemic going on, especially in New York and New Jersey, you would be lucky to have a gun for protection

I am going to Trump National Doral in Miami today to check out the brand new and just opened BLUE MONSTER and the spectacular driving range.

If you don't believe in yourself, no one else will.

Personally, I think Douglas Durst's brother got screwed by Douglas--no wonder he's angry.

. @AGSchneiderman Why is Douglas Durst allowed to use the Freedom Tower to get out of a lease with Conde Nast?

. @Richard_Meier , a highly overrated architect, has had many problems with buildings he has designed.

Secret Service members on break from Obama’s $4M vacation are more than welcomed to relax at Hawaii’s top hotel @TrumpWaikiki .

Lightweight @AGSchneiderman is pushing for the Moreland Commission to be disbanded immediately--because he is being looked at!

Guess what, folks--the ObamaCare website just went down again. What a disaster.

If you can’t adapt to new situations then you will never be successful. Every change is a new opportunity to use your talent.

Pres. Obama is about to embark on a 17 day vacation in his ‘native’ Hawaii, putting Secret Service away from families on Christmas. Aloha!

No cuts to welfare, no cuts to food stamps & NOT A SINGLE CUT TO OBAMACARE, yet the new budget cuts military benefits. Sad!

I am so honored by all the great NY State Repubs who came to my office, called & wrote for me to run for Governor. If I do, I will win.

New York Republican leader @EdwardFCox is pushing my friend @RobAstorino into political suicide. Results won’t be pleasant!

Enough about my ties etc. @Macys , but they are doing really big numbers - people love them (and @Macys loves Trump)!

"@briansaheed: @realDonaldTrump Governor Cuomo won't get any real challenge unless it's Mr. Trump.." True!

I like Rob Astorino. He's a friend and really good guy. Sadly, he has ZERO chance of beating Cuomo and the 2 to 1 Dems for governor!

Go to Macy's today and buy Trump ties, shirts, suits and cufflinks as a Christmas or holiday present.Great style, great price! ONLY THE BEST

The coolest story is that John Beale, the man who headed up CLIMATE CHANGE for the government, is a proven con man and total phoney.ARRESTED

The more time you spend feeling sorry for yourself, the more time you waste after a setback. Move on and quickly embrace the next challenge!

We should be focusing on beautiful, clean air & not on wasteful & very expensive GLOBAL WARMING bullshit! China & others are hurting our air

They call it "climate change" now because the words "global warming" didn't work anymore. Same people fighting hard to keep it all going!

59% of the United States, by area, is now covered in snow-highest % in many years. The "global warming" name isn't working anymore-SORRY!

Wow, it's snowing in Isreal and on the pyramids in Egypt. Are we still wasting billions on the global warming con? MAKE U.S. COMPETITIVE!

President Obama and other world leaders don't know how close they were to being seriously injured (or worse) standing next to psycho in SA.

The United States is experiencing the coldest weather in decades with vast amounts of snow blanketing many states.Pendulum has swung to cool

@Macys The Donald J. Trump signature line of shirts, ties, really beautiful suits and cufflinks is the best Christmas & holiday gift by far

Have a GREAT weekend everybody - enjoy yourself but always keep your goals and aspirations in mind. Never lose sight of the victory ahead!

@VanityFair I love to see garbage properly disposed of which is why I like watching the dismal circulation numbers of Vanity Fair-IT'S DEAD

I really like Nelson Mandela but South Africa is a crime ridden mess that is just waiting to explode-not a good situation for the people!

“Is business success a natural talent? I think it’s a combination of aptitude, work and luck.” – Think Like a Champion

The evidence continues to mount against lightweight @AGSchneiderman . It is time for JCOPE and Moreland Commissions to act.

@PolitiFact ’s #LieOfTheYear is Obama’s if you like your health care plan, you can keep it. Wrong. It’s the lie of the decade.

The ill-conceived windfarm that @AlexSalmond is pushing for Aberdeen will lose $50 million a year. Only a fool would build it or want it!

If Graydon Carter's very dumb bosses would fire him for his terrible circulation numbers at failing Vanity Fair-his bad food restaurants die

Bird killing windfarm that I oppose in Aberdeen got delayed by at least two years. @AlexSalmond forced the failing developers to delay!

Sources inside @AGSchneiderman ’s office are saying that they are very concerned with the allegations against their lightweight boss.

My complaint against @AGSchneiderman is a “case study” for JCOPE & Moreland Commissions on everything that is wrong with NYS politics.

Can you believe that the corrupt and pathetic South Africa police force has yet to arrest the sign language guy. Such danger-give 10 years!

What a sad thing that the memory of Nelson Mandela will be stained by the phoney sign language moron who is in every picture at funeral!

" @Lisa_Smith70 A real president wouldn't take a selfie during ANY memorial service. #NelsonMandelaMemorial "

How amazing, the State Health Director who verified copies of Obama’s “birth certificate” died in plane crash today. All others lived

I hope you all are looking at the Donald J. Trump Signature Collection of ties, shirts & cufflinks @Macys —great for Christmas & holidays.

A $1.5B website that can only handle 50K users at a time is sad but no surprise!

Our prayers are with Rev. @BillyGraham for a speedy recovery. His faith continues to inspire us all.

Had dinner last night at Megu, 845 United Nations Plaza--fabulous food, beautiful restaurant.

This is one of the COLDEST WINTERS ever, freezing all over the country for long periods of time! So much for GLOBAL WARMING.

Why does Conde Nast allow dopey Graydon Carter to run bad food restaurants while running failing @VanityFair magazine?

President Obama's approval rating, at 38%, is at an all-time low. Gee, I wonder why?

@TrumpDoral The brand new Blue Monster at Trump National Doral has recieved GREAT reviews from the golf critics. Check it out-opens Dec. 14

@TrumpDoral The Blue Monster at Trump National Doral opens for play on Saturday morning after a massive rebuilding - brand new course!

It's amazing how badly the Knicks and Nets are playing. Everybody predicted they would be top teams with all of the money spent. Too bad!

Re Kerry admitting to “working” for Pastor Abedini’s release--why has US already released Iranian spies & nuclear scientist? Dumb!

. @JohnKerry claims he has "never stopped working” f/Pastor Abedini’s release through “back channels." Where are the results?

" @YMatthews956 Have u ever considered meeting w/ Obama? He might be open to your wisdom & business savvy." I doubt it!

WH claims it lied about Pres. Obama living with his uncle b/c “wasn’t mentioned in his book.” I guess Bill Ayers never knew about it!

Graydon Carter, whose reign over failing @VanityFair has been a disaster, has acted in two movies--both bombed & got bad reviews.

It’s time for @PeteRose_14 to enter @MLB ’s @BaseballHall . All time hits leader has paid the price.

Congrats to @JoeTorre , @TonyLaRussa & Bobby Cox on all being unanimously elected to @MLB ’s @BaseballHall ! Great leaders & managers.

Just read @PiersMorgan ’s book “Shooting Straight” and whether you love him or hate him (I’m in the first category), it is terrific.

Just left Florida, amazing how well State is doing-- jobs way up, taxes down. Congrats to @FLGovScott

Dopey Graydon Carter, who is presiding over dying @VanityFair magazine, is also presiding over dying Waverly Inn—worst food in city.

I really enjoy doing @foxandfriends every Monday at 7 AM. @sdoocy, @ehasselbeck and @kilmeade are great people.

The Unaffordable Care Act, sometimes referred to as ObamaCare, is not working. Millions of people are losing their plans and doctors-fraud!

Obama said he never met his uncle, Oscar, who was arrested for whatever. Turns out he lived with his uncle in Boston. SO MANY LIES!

@VanityFair Wow, I just looked at the circulation numbers - Vanity Fair Magazine won't be around much longer, it's really in bad shape!

Just got back to New York from California. Will be on Fox & Friends tomorrow morning at 7.00. ObamaCare and other disasters to be discussed

P.S. - There is also something really good to say about humility. Being confident and humble is a great combination, maybe the best of all!

Iran has never had a better friend than Obama.

. @BillBratton was a great choice for NYC Police Commissioner. He will make us proud, and safe!

@KBetter52 Thank you.

We should be focused on magnificently clean and healthy air and not distracted by the expensive hoax that is global warming!

The problem w/ the concept of "global warming" is that the U.S. is spending a fortune on "fixing it" while China & others do nothing!

Wow, record setting cold temperatures throughout large parts of the country. Must be global warming, I mean climate change!

@puddlejumper365 You have to have passion for your work. That's most important. Then keep your focus intact. Good luck.

You can only smile when the losers of the world try so hard to put down successful people. Just remember, they all want to be YOU!

With few exceptions, only really smart people are able to make a lot of money. Hard work is also important, but "brains" will supersede.

I just filed a major ethics complaint against crooked New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman-he should resign from office!

Too bad about New York Magazine, but there's a much bigger one out there, currently doing a story on me to get even, that I'll soon discuss!

Remember I predicted that New York Magazine would fold and people scoffed? Just announced (N.Y.Post) it lost big $'s & is cutting way back!

@10AJMcCarron AJ is a GREAT quarterback who is finally being recognized as such - a total winner. What a pass!

Wow, the ObamaCare website, which President Obama said would be working TODAY, is a total mess with many functions not even thought about!

Just left $259 million rebuilding of Doral in Miami. Amazing - Trump National Doral will be a masterpiece (if I do say so myself)!

I hope you buy my shirts and ties at @Macys

@RSPBScotland RSPB IS A TOTAL JOKE-They went for bird chopping wind turbines in @Aberdeenshire and fought me on bird friendly golf course!

@RSPBScotland Florida Everglades project abandoned after it was determined that tens of thousands of birds would be killed by wind turbines!

@RSPBScotland @alexsalmond , the same man that released Pan Am terrorist for humane reasons, will destroy Scotland with grotesque turbines!

@RSPBScotland must fight to save the massive bird population which will be devastated by wind turbines in @Aberdeenshire . @alexsalmond

HAPPY THANKSGIVING EVERYONE, ENJOY YOUR DAY!

I truly believe that our country has the worst and dumbest negotiators of virtually any country in the world.

Can you believe that "President" Karzai of Afghanistan is holding out for more, more, more and refuses to sign deal. Tell him to go to hell!

Despite the fact that I have had great success with the words YOU'RE FIRED, I do not like firing people. But ZERO on ObamaCare mess-no way!

Why doesn't President Obama simply apologize for telling a big fat lie, announce that ObamaCare was a mistake, and deal a really great plan!

US froze $8B in Iranian assets during ’79 Hostage Crisis. Now Obama is giving it back to Iran while Christian Pastor is jailed. Don't do it!

Happy Thanksgiving to all--even the haters and losers!

Tell Iran to let our Christian Pastor go--and I mean right now. If they don't, there will be hell to pay.

Make sure to enjoy your time with your family during the holiday. It is a special time. Love and appreciate your family.

The $1B failed website is the tip of the iceberg on the ObamaCare. Over 90 million estimated will lose their plans next year.

@FrankMDavisJR @TrumpTowerNY Thanks.

@mckay317 @TrumpTowerNY I will check it out, thanks.

Mr. President, tell Iran to immediately free the CHRISTIAN PASTOR, as a sign of good faith, & if they refuse break off talks--big sanctions

President Obama said, over and over again, if you like your plan, you can keep your plan, PERIOD! This turned out to be a total lie-90 mill.

Look at the solution, not the problem. Learn to focus on what will give results.

Set the example. You can motivate others as well as yourself by remembering that you are setting the example.

How does Obama rationalize giving Iran $8B in sanction relief when a Christian pastor is being tortured in an Iranian prison?

When do we sue the company-- for billions-- that robbed us in creating the hapless ObamaCare website?

I can't believe no one has been fired over the ObamaCare website fiasco!

Vision remains vision until you focus, do the work, and bring it down to earth where it will do some good.

I will be in Palm Beach, Jupiter, and Miami today checking on big construction projects. I love Florida and love on time and on budget const

"@LeChrisPace Following @realDonaldTrump was probably my best decision #bear " Thanks.

President Obama is finally getting hammered, even by his most loyal supporters and the press-I guess they can only take so much!

New poll, WOW-53% say President Obama is not honest & trustworthy. What took them so long. Go back and look at his house purchase in Chicago

Don't worry, THE UNITED STATES WILL BE GREAT AGAIN!

Just got home, watching the news, and every story is bad about the U.S. Someday we will return to being great again, but we need leadership!

“The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it.” – The Art of The Deal.

Obama is going to take away over 90M Americans’ healthcare plans but he is letting Iran keep its nukes. Just think about that.

Who would you rather have negotiating with Iran--President Obama or Toronto Mayor Ford? My money is on Ford.

Realize that being an entrepreneur is not a group effort. You're in charge. Everything starts with you.

Don't underestimate yourself or your possibilities--keep your focus intact, and focus on the positives.

After settling for a ridicilous 13 billion dollars, J.P.Morgan's lawyer is critical of the amount of the fine-why did they settle then-DUMB!

Best book ever on dealmaking (or so they say) - TRUMP: THE ART OF THE DEAL. Go get it, and others, Washington - you really can do better!

I know it has been many years since our country made great deals, but isn't it about time we start, right now. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

The reason great dealmakers do not OPENLY celebrate a deal, especially one that is not complete, is that it shows weakness to the other side

John Kerry is openly celebrating the tenuous nuclear deal with Iran. Great dealmakers do not celebrate deals,they just go on to the next one

Tom Brady is a good friend of mine, a great player, a great guy and a total winner! Fantastic comeback win-this is what our country needs!

Tom Brady has done a great job tonight-amazing New England comeback. Good game- not over yet!

We had all the leverage in our nuclear negotiations with Iran and our leaders foolishly decided to let them out of the trap. WHY?

How much longer are we expected to put up with the world's most incompetent leader - ObamaCare, Iran, Syria, bads deals. JUST NEVER ENDS

I will be on Fox & Friends tomorrow morning at 7. Will be discussing basic stupidity and incompetence, of which our "leaders" have plenty!

I do not understand how so many of my Jewish friends backed Obama in the last election. He is a TOTAL DISASTER FOR ISRAEL-AND ALWAYS WILL BE

How far has the United States gone down when we are reduced to accept the imbecilic deal just agreed to with Iran. Read THE ART OF THE DEAL!

What a rotten deal we made with Iran. We get nothing (except laughter at our stupidity). They get everything, including delay and big cash!

They changed the name global warming to climate change because the concept of global warming just wasn't working!

The people that gave you global warming are the same people that gave you ObamaCare!

Snow and ice, freezing weather, in Texas, Arizona and Oklahoma - what the hell is going on with GLOBAL WARMING?

Get smart on knockout assaults and crime - we have to be slightly more vicious (and violent) than the assaulter-and crime would end FAST!

The scum that gets high on badly hurting old ladies and others through knockout assaults wouldn't feel that way with a gun at their head!

We are using the absolute wrong negotiating technique with respect to the Iran nuclear talks. Strengthen sanctions until GREAT deal is made!

" @WhiteShaunwhite I dedicate my 750 tweet to most inspiring entrepreneurs of our time @realDonaldTrump , @BillGates " Thx.

Young entrepreneurs – keep positive. Don’t let the ObamaCare disaster stop your endeavors. There are great opportunities out there.

@Pattycake77777 Happy Birthday!

It’s Friday. How many millions has the White House wasted on the ObamaCare website today?

Republicans have the right approach to ObamaCare – let it fail. Free market solutions will be embraced by Americans in 2016.

Thomas Jefferson wrote the Senate filibuster rule. Harry Reid & Obama killed it yesterday. Rule was in effect for over 200 years.

Since the Democrats decided to kill the filibuster, they now own it.Republicans should keep the new rule when they're in the majority.

If JP Morgan took their case through the courts for 15 years, nobody would be suing them—easy target.

For all those sick degenerates contemplating a knockout attack, please remember the late, great Charles Bronson-no more crime!

Weak newscasters are asking "is there a racial component to knockout attacks?" Of course there is and weakness will only make it worse!

If you are lucky enough to catch a knockout assaulter before getting slugged, and you carry a gun, shoot the bastard (teach them a lesson)!

Knockout assaults are the new rage by sick and depraved youth. We better start getting tough in this country-and they want to take our guns!

I will be going to Trump National Doral in Miami early today to check on the construction of the hotel and the new Blue Monster. AMAZING!

How did the NCAA, which is weak and becoming irrelevant, extract such a big & reputation shattering settlement from Penn State. Others zero!

Maybe some of the dead voters who helped get President Obama elected can be brought back to life after signing up for ObamaCare.

The wimps that run Penn State should be forced to resign (and be sued) for the pathetic settlement they made and destruction of great legacy

"@MArloAmoriello1: @realDonaldTrump Donald we can't allow this country to become soft like Obama, and penn state! Please run in 2016 #leader

I wonder if the Rutgers coach who had the audacity to yell at the player is a proponent of global warming?

Football coaches are no longer allowed to scream and yell at their players because it is discriminatory,racist and can be viewed as bullying

I wonder what the late, great Vince Lombardi would say about the Rutgers football player who says he is being bullied because coach yelled?

The real J.P.Morgan is spinning in his grave at the ridiculous settlements the bank is making to settle disputes. A settler is a soft target

13 BILLION, 4.5 BILLION-these are the stupid settlements that J.P.Morgan just made. Why don't they FIGHT? No wonder they keep getting sued.

@MikeDemkiw True!

Breaking news--negotiations with Iranians broke down because Obama insisted that they use ObamaCare.

President Obama is the best thing that ever happened to Jimmy Carter!

In a new poll a majority of people felt the president "knowingly lied" about health care pledge. Who are the fools who don't think he lied?

@BretBaier You are doing really great - keep it up (of which I have no doubt).

The same people that built the ObamaCare website used, as the face of the website, someone who is not a US citizen. Incompetent.

Can you believe it—the model who mysteriously disappeared from the ObamaCare website is not a US citizen—she’s from Colombia.

No matter how far down a path you go, if it's the wrong path, turn around and go back home - before it is too late.

ObamaCare is on LIFE SUPPORT - it will soon be DEAD ON ARRIVAL - A bad concept that was imcompetently administered!

President Obama is under pressure from Democrats to undo his lie on ObamaCare. His problem is that such a move would end ObamaCare.

ObamaCare is one of the worst political disasters of all time - 4,992,343 AMERICANS LOSING COVERAGE, LESS THAN 50,OOO NEW SIGNUPS.

Everyone should watch the documentary ‘Windfall’ on @netflix . See an upstate NY town ruined by environmentalists & windfarms.

@oliviaculpo @AgalarovAras @eminofficial @IamStevenT @crocuscityhall Crocus City Hall in Moscow is a fabulous place!

Miss USA pageant had a 4 to 1 vote in favor, but it won't be in Miami Doral in 2014-- Mayor Boria voted against it. I want total support!

@eminofficial Emin, your performance at Miss Universe was fantastic - you are a STAR!

@Judithdbailey Thank you!

@WCMartzOfficial Thank you.

“True courage is being afraid, and going ahead and doing your job anyhow!” - General Norman Schwarzkopf

@AgalarovAras I had a great weekend with you and your family. You have done a FANTASTIC job. TRUMP TOWER-MOSCOW is next. EMIN was WOW!

. @IamStevenT gave one of the greatest endings to a show ever @MissUniverse . Standing ovation!

Happy Veterans Day to ALL, in particular to the haters and losers who have no idea how lucky they are!!!

WE WILL ONLY BE THE LAND OF THE FREE AS LONG AS WE ARE HOME OF THE BRAVE!

Don't worry, when our country starts hurting bad enough from all of the mistakes that are being made, we will start doing the right things.

While I was in Moscow I see that President Obsma apologized for his lie, I mean statement, on ObamaCare! How nice of him to be so forthright

The Republicans must be patient and smart - ObamaCare could sweep them into office in far greater numbers than anyone ever thought possible!

If Justice Roberts had done the right thing and voted against ObamaCare, our country would be in a lot better shape right now! TOTAL TURMOIL

Drew Brees is having a great game - a fantastic quarterback and really good guy!

If we could force Russia, China and other competitors to use ObamaCare, we would be able to instantly destroy their great economic success!

Remember that I predicted a long time ago that President Obama will attack Iran because of his inability to negotiate properly-not skilled!

I will be on Fox & Friends tomorrow morning at 7.ºº

I just got back from Russia-learned lots & lots. Moscow is a very interesting and amazing place! U.S. MUST BE VERY SMART AND VERY STRATEGIC.

"@gutterferret: @realDonaldTrump tell us in a Vine! Your voice carries so much more impact! #TrumpVine " O.K., on Monday!

I was just given a great tour of Moscow - fantastic, hard working people. CITY IS REALLY ENERGIZED! The World will be watching tonight!

I'm in Moscow for Miss Universe tonight - picking a winner is very hard, they are all winners. Total sellout of arena. Big night in Russia!

Leadership: Whatever happens, you're responsible. If it doesn't happen, you're responsible.

Being successful requires nothing less than 100% of your concentrated effort. Be totally focused.

Success tip: Be ready for problems, and be patient--there are very few cases of instant gratification.

“Read the Bible. Work hard and honestly. And don't complain.” – Rev. @BillyGraham

Upstate New York needs jobs. Frack Now & Frack Fast! Pay off NY State debt.

We still have not learned the full truth on Benghazi. Four Americans were killed. Congress must act!

At least 3.5M fellow Americans are going to lose their healthcare plans because of ObamaCare. Defund then repeal!

Looking forward to attending the GREAT Rev. @BillyGraham ’s birthday party tonight--there's nobody like him!

Had dinner this week at @MEGUNYC (at Trump World Tower) opposite the United Nations—fantastic food! 212.964.7777

"THEBillMcGee @realDonaldTrump -after a year of wear your shirts still look great! Glad I made the purchase!" Thank you.

I will be going to Asheville, North Carolina, tonight for the 95th birthday party of the GREAT Billy Graham - such a wonderful man!

If Democrats do not start opposing ObamaCare, and fast, Republicans will have a massive victory in 2014 - far greater than any predictions!

A level will be reached where ObamaCare will be so out of control, expensive and unwieldy that the biggest supporters will abandon ship.

Prediction: The disaster known as ObamaCare will only get worse and Republicans will gain far greater power than they have had in years!

Put Kathleen Sebelius out of her misery and lovingly say, YOU'RE FIRED! Let her go home to her family and rest. BRING IN TOP FLIGHT PEOPLE!

She is so sad and pathetic that I almost feel sorry for Sec.Sebelius. She has done great harm to many people and must be fired. Incompetent!

Just sit back and watch, ObamaCare is such a disaster it will fall like a house of broken cards. The website is the best part of this mess!

When Obama tried to tweak his previous statement on ObamaCare he made it an even greater lie-even the Senate Democrats are angry with him!

Use your intelligence and your education to execute what your imagination presents to you. This is one step to becoming an entrepreneur.

Job tip: If you were the employer, what kind of person would you most desire as an employee? Be that person.

Success tip: See yourself as victorious. This will focus you in the right direction. Apply your skills and talent--and be tenacious.

"@mzulianix3: @realDonaldTrump you are the coolest man I've ever met " Thank you!

Our NOBEL PRIZE FOR PEACE president said "I'm really good at killing people" according to just out book Double Down. Can Oslo retract prize?

The truth is that we could have much better healthcare in our country at a much more affordable price - everyone in U.S. would benefit!

Can you believe that the builder of the failed ObamaCare website was just given a new government contract - how stupid is that - CLUELESS!!!

Revisionist history. Now Obama claims he never told us that everyone could keep their healthcare plans. Crazy!

I would gain a whole new respect for President Obama if he would say, "look, we made a big mistake, sorry!" No more lies or deception.

Lies and incompetence - the two words that are most closely associated with ObamaCare!

"@Rizz_Lizz: @realDonaldTrump @andersengell Mr.President, DJT, could do this in his sleep! Light years ahead of opponents.

Wow, just watching the news.ObamaCare and the website are TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL. Costs are through the roof. This could be ruinous to U.S.!

@GOP House has the right bill: “If you like your healthcare plan, you can keep it.” The Senate must take it up on a vote!

The ObamaCare website will cost over $1.5B when all is said and done. Crazy!

@zak_boxer Never give up!

@MrD1202 Have passion for your work and keep focused.

@JShue20 Great!

Everyone is telling me that @EliotSpitzer is going to run against lightweight @AGSchneiderman --Spitzer would win!

"@earn_it_work: @realDonaldTrump @billmaher see trump? He takes his shots but has no balls. Don't listen and do us a favor and run for POTUS

Millions losing healthcare plans despite President Obama's promise that this WOULD NOT HAPPEN! What about a massive protest march on D.C.

Looks like a very good World Series game!

How come Snowden and ObamaCare have access to all records and information but don't have even the smallest tidbits on President Obama?

ObamaCare is a disaster and Snowden is a spy who should be executed-but if it and he could reveal Obama's records,I might become a major fan

“You're never a loser until you quit trying.” - Mike Ditka

China just called. They want to lend Obama another $1B for the ObamaCare web site.

If Obama was willing to lie about ObamaCare then what else has he lied to us about…

Four brave Americans died in Benghazi. Administration is still covering up the truth. We deserve to know the full truth.

Congrats to @rushlimbaugh on the release of his new book “Rush Revere and the Brave Pilgrims.” #1 on @amazon and @bnbooks . Must read!

It is now a FACT that President Obama lied in order to get ObamaCare passed-that is fraud and the legislation should be recinded-INTERESTING

"@haay_ramiiie: @realDonaldTrump has the best twitter"

I hear @billmaher really bombed in Springfield--people were leaving show way early--stupid guy!

Won’t be a buyer’s market for long. If you can, purchase a home but remember, I told you this three years ago.

Fact – all the countries complaining about us spying on them spy on us. They just don't get caught--stupid!

. @AlexSalmond of Scotland may be the dumbest leader of the free world. I can’t imagine that anyone wants him in office.

. @AlexSalmond –the man who let terrorist (Pan Am Flight 103) al-Megrahi go, lost another battle over ugly wind turbines in Blackdog.

. @AlexSalmond suffered a huge defeat by the people of Blackdog. Communities all over Scotland are fighting this loser.

When will @AlexSalmond realize that he's destroying Scotland--the most beautiful countryside in the world w/ his stupid wind turbines?

Great victory for people of Blackdog, Scotland. They defeated substation, stopping inefficient & ugly wind turbines. @AlexSalmond

Maybe if Obama knew too much about the spying it would be worse than knowing nothing - but either way it is just another disaster!

I just don't know why some of these NFL teams with lousy quarterbacks don't give Tim Tebow a chance - what do they have to lose?

There are so many blatant lies coming out of the ADMINISTRATION - healthcare, spying, NSA, IRS, brutally killed Americans -WILL IT EVER END?

Does anybody really think that President Obama didn't know about our spying on the leaders of allies around the world - not possible!

Like your current health care plan? Too bad, you’re going to lose it under ObamaCare. Hope, Change & a 300% Increase in Your Premium.

Contractors can blame Obama admin all day for their $600M failure but both parties are at fault--pay taxpayers back.

I don’t know why our allies are so surprised Obama is tapping their phones? Nothing changes!

"@AKudej25: @realDonaldTrump We wont see REAL change unless you become President! #PleaseRun #2016" True!

Isn't it amazing that the U.S. and NSA can listen to the highly protected phone conversations of world leaders but can't get O's records!

At this point the legacy of the Obama Administration will be, sadly, that of THE GANG THAT COULDN'T SHOOT STRAIGHT - what a pathetic mess!

With the $635 million dollar website fiasco, getting caught tapping phones of WORLD LEADERS and so much more, U.S. is looking really stupid!

If the Saudis are so concerned about Syria then they should go in themselves. Stop telling us to do their dirty work.

I’ll soon be leaving for Washington where @AmSpec will give me the T. Boone Pickens Entrepreneur Award. Very exciting!

Where’s the accountability for the $635M website fiasco in the Obama administration? Heads should roll and officials should be fired

Why doesn't President Obama call upon the NSA to fix the badly broken website-then they could spy on all of the many cheaters & arrest them!

Honestly, whether you're for or against ObamaCare, the 635 million dollar website fiasco is bad for the U.S. It makes us look totally inept!

Breaking news - The Washington Redskins have just announced that they will be removing the name Washington from their name!

@NYMag Can you imagine a top editor at New York Magazine calling for my death-if they were responsible, he would be fired! Totally biased.

No wonder @NYMag is doing so poorly, with an idiot Sr. Editor like @DanAmira , it will only get worse!

@DanAmira @NYMag A terrible statement like that shows how desperate you and your magazine are. You should be ashamed.

Canadians kicked out the firm that the U.S. paid all that money to for the failed website. How stupid are our "leaders"? This is a scandal!

Wow, China's growth accelerated 7.8% in third quarter. If the U.S. had half that number we would be the talk of the World - need leadership

No surprise Saudis turned down spot on UN Security Council. They don’t want responsibility. Just have us do their heavy lifting.

I love watching the dishonest writers @NYMag suffer the magazine’s failure.

Our country is being run by total amateurs. Let’s just call it “amateur hour.”

ObamaCare website fiasco was a SINGLE bid to a Canadian company - terrible!

I build beautiful websites with very smart and imaginative people for almost NOTHING. OUR GOVERNMENT SPENT ALMOST $535, 000, 000 for NOTHING

The contract to build the ObamaCare website was given to a CANADIAN company for $55, 744, 081. It then bloated to $292, 071,067 INCOMPETENCE

By the way, New York State MUST LOWER TAXES (and fast) and must start going after all of the "energy" that lies just below our feet (now)!

Thanks for all of the great support but I just don't see myself wanting to run for Governor of New York - I have something else in mind!

If the U.S. Government doesn't give the money necessary for the burials of our military personnel, I will.The U.S. under Obama's leadership!

It is outrageous and disgusting that families of U.S. MILITARY personnel killed in action will not be given money for burials. SAD!

"@motleyhoney: @realDonaldTrump I say go for it, solid business leadership for a change. Congrats on the new development in Vancouver"Thanks

@GenallKasmikha I notice, thanks Genall!

With President Obama it's all talk and no action. Our country is in desperate need of smart and decisive leadership before it is too late!

I'm just so tired of listening to the same old rhetoric and words, day after day, from our President. It's time to stop talking-WORK!

Florida Power & Light has disgusting rotting utility poles outside Doral in Miami. They should put in new ones or will be sued.

In my opinion, one of the worst utility companies in the country is Florida Power and Light.

Did you ever think our country would become an economic basket case? So much for Hope & Change.

@Jon_dennis82 @Redskins True.

@myangel82 @bobbymayojr Thanks.

@jeffanie Thank you.

President Obama wants to change the name of the "White House" because it is highly discriminating and not at all politically correct!

President should not be telling the Washington Redskins to change their name-our country has far bigger problems! FOCUS on them,not nonsense

My sense is that people are far angrier at the President than they are at Congress re the shutdown—an interesting turn!

83% of the government is still running during the shutdown while 41% of nondefense federal workers are furloughed. Room for cuts.

Obama is tougher on WWII vets wanting to visit a DC memorial than Iran. He needs to show respect to our vets and not play games.

Government is shut down yet Obama is now harassing the privately owned @Redskins to change its name.He needs to focus on his job!

Standing strong for his people, @GovWalker is ignoring the Feds and keeping all Wisconsin parks open. Great!

The Obama Administration has a very important duty to provide a budget - and then negotiate! OUR COUNTRY is a laughingstock!

Obama administration had 4 years to prepare for the ObamaCare rollout. And of course they failed miserably.

Obama and the Democrats have no respect for WWII vets trying to get into the memorial.

Many Red-State Democrats sticking with Obama on deficit spending on the ObamaCare monstrosity will be defeated in 2014.

Oil has been over $33/gallon for 34 months. A new record. And now with Obama’s war on coal, American families will be hit even harder.

‘Moderate’ Repubs plotting against @GOP strategy have short term memories. Tea Party gave them majority in House & primaries aren't fun.

Obama has not passed a single budget in 4 years. Democrats don’t even vote them in Congress. He has failed to lead!

Obama & the Democrats want this shutdown. They think it helps their electoral prospects for 2014. Don’t believe!

Achievers move forward at all times. Achievement is not a plateau, it's a beginning.

The Republicans can absolutely win if they stick together-but they are NOT sticking together. Sen. McCain just said "we can't win".Very bad!

Remember that in 2006 then Senator Obama voted NOT TO INCREASE THE DEBT CEILING. Now he acts in disbelief as others plan to do the same!

Business is an art in itself, and powerful negotiation skills are one of the techniques necessary to facilitate success.

The commodity market is extremely fragile. Be wary of investing right now. The futures are way too dependent on the Fed.

Wow, Eliot Spitzer has lost - great news for New York City!

Bottom line, I don't think President changed people's minds - must hope for a lifeline from Putin, a very dangerous lifeline at that!

We will have to see what Russia's next move will be. They may have given him an out of an embarrassing situation or drove into deeper mess!

He is working hard and for that he must be given credit!

@ArsenioHall Arsenio, may your run be long, successful and important-just be yourself and you will be a smash! Good luck.

I'll be going to the Old Post Office Building on Pennsylvania Avenue in D.C. today. Will create one of world's great hotels. Lots of jobs!

Do you believe what is going on in Washington with respect to Syria - these people don't have a clue!

@LonghornHomer He is not smart enough to understand!

@Toure Why does a network allow a stupid racist like Toure to stay on the air when his ratings are so abysmal! Can there be only one reason

Icahn, Kravis, Zell, Buffett have all used the bankrutcy law to their benefit. Many of the top business people do.

"@notleadinglady: @realDonaldTrump @Toure Mr. Trump how is Toure a racist? I just don't see it." Not enough people watch him to know!

@Toure Dumb as a rock Toure doesn't have a clue about money or anything else-merely a simpleton racist.Really bad ratings,really stupid guy

“It is hard to fail, but it is worse never to have tried to succeed.” -Theodore Roosevelt

Our economy is in trouble. The unemployed are more likely to drop out of the workforce than find a job. We need growth-- and now!

Iraq has granted Iran full air rights to fly over and arm Syria. What did America accomplish with the Iraq war? And now Syria?!

This week will mark the 1 year anniversary of the attack in Benghazi that left 4 Americans dead. No answers!

Now Obama has set red line 2 with demand that Assad hands over Syria’s chemical weapons or it will face an attack.

Congratulations to @serenawilliams on her superb @usopen win. She is terrific!

@TheBig_Easy Ernie--You are doing a great job with #autismsupport --glad to help. See you at Trump National, Jupiter.

Don't attack Syria - an attack that will bring nothing but trouble for the U.S. Focus on making our country strong and great again!

Why are we fighting for the "rebels" that hate us-only to save face for Obama!

President Obama, do not attack Syria. There is no upside and tremendous downside. Save your "powder" for another (and more important) day!

Isn't it intetesting that anybody who attacks President Obama is considered a racist by the real racists out there!

"@UnabashedProg: @realDonaldTrump @thegroveguru can you imagine serious people comparing modern warfare to a football game? ACTUALLY YES!

"@RLSteetle: @realDonaldTrump I'm addicted to your books. Are you writing another any time soon?" At some point, there is so much to write!

Speaking of our very stupid war with Iraq, it is totally disintegrating and Iran (with Russia) will walk in and take it over (lots of oil)!

@lucindamac Thank you, but we are dealing with many very stupid people!

I'm a Republican but not a fan of the last George Bush-he also was a lousy President (Iraq etc.). In fact, he was so bad he gave us Obama!

Former President Jimmy Carter is so happy that he is no longer considered the worst President in the history of the United States!

Syria has been given so much time that much of the things we were going to bomb have been moved into civilian areas! A polititian's war.

Just watching NBC News where our potential attack is being detailed-the exact ships, the stealth bombers, the destinations-so ridiculous!

If Syria was forced to use Obamacare they would self-destruct without a shot being fired. Obama should sell them that idea!

When we have big disasters, no one comes to our aid or even suggests helping - but we are always expected to come to the aid of others!

“Remember the golden rule of negotiating: ‘He who has the gold makes the rules.’” – Midas Touch

I am not angry at Russia (or China) because their leaders are far smarter than ours. We need real leadership, and fast,before it is too late

I wonder how much our "leaders" have promised, or given, Russia in order for them to behave and not make the U.S. look even worse?

Really bad news just announced concerning jobs. Far fewer jobs created in August than anticipated. Interest rates, therefore, to remain low.

We don't have the leadership, including the Generals (who just said the element of surprise does not matter) to attack anyone! Cool it.

Did you ever see a situation so ridiculous as our President explaining what, when and where to Congress about a Syrian attack. Far too late!

The terrorists in Syria are calling themselves REBELS and getting away with it because our leaders are so completely stupid!

We should not attack Syria but if they make the stupid move to do so, the Arab League,whose members are laughing at us, should pay!

“If you plan for the worst – if you can live with the worst – the good will always take care of itself.” – The Art of the Deal

Russia is sending a fleet of ships to the Mediterranean. Obama’s war in Syria has the potential to widen into a worldwide conflict.

It will be interesting to see what happens to Eliot Spitzer if he loses the election for Comptroller to very capable @scottmstringer .

I have just lost my beautiful & elegant long time exec. assistant Norma Foerderer. She passed away yesterday – a truly magnificent woman.

AGAIN, TO OUR VERY FOOLISH LEADER, DO NOT ATTACK SYRIA - IF YOU DO MANY VERY BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN & FROM THAT FIGHT THE U.S. GETS NOTHING!

While everyone is waiting and prepared for us to attack Syria, maybe we should knock the hell out of Iran and their nuclear capabilities?

If you look at the horrible picture on the front page of the NY Times of the "rebels" executing prisoners, you would say forget the rebels!

Tell Congress to straighten out the many problems of our country before trying to be the policemen to the world. Make America great again!

"@Bchipper83: @realDonaldTrump haha I love how you just tell like it is! You aren't who you are by not doing just that!" Thank you!

The only reason President Obama wants to attack Syria is to save face over his very dumb RED LINE statement. Do NOT attack Syria,fix U.S.A.

President Obama put himself in a very bad position when he talked about Syria crossing the RED LINE. Amazingly, now he denies he said that!

@SHAWSHANK5 " @realDonaldTrump To be a champ. you have to believe in yourself when nobody else will" True!

For all of those fools that want to attack Syria, the U.S.has lost the vital element of surprise-so stupid-could be a disaster!

What I am saying is stay out of Syria.

The great GENERALS MacArthur and Patton, real leaders and fighters, are spinning in their graves as we give Syria info & time to prepare.

"@Trill_Blowa: If the government just listened to @realDonaldTrump this country would be so much better!"

"@Devante4Liberty: @realDonaldTrump But if we had a Republican President you would say the exact opposite right?" Wrong!

Think of it, the Arab League doesn't want to get involved with Syria - but they want us to do their dirty work. How stupid!

If the U.S. attacks Syria and hits the wrong targets, killing civilians, there will be worldwide hell to pay. Stay away and fix broken U.S.

Our country is looking very bad right now!

"@Rizz_Lizz: @realDonaldTrump I am surprised Weiner is so delusional to think that he still has a shot! should seek help.

@ArsenioHall After Arsenio won Celebrity Apprentice he told me, in tears, that I would be his first guest if he got a show. No interest!

Eliot Spitzer has failed at everything he has ever done, and now he wants to be comptroller. Thrown out of politics and off of TV, CRAZY!

Each time I see one of Anthony Weiner's television ads for mayor I ask, what the hell is he doing just wasting money & time-go get a job!

"@mikethoms85: @realDonaldTrump with all due respect, Bush did exactly the same thing in Iraq." You will seldom see me defending Bush.

@tkeller316 Thanks!

In war, the elememt of surprise is sooooo important.What the hell is Obama doing.

We have given Syria so much time and information-there has never been such an instance in wartime history. Syria is now fully prepared!

Why isn't the Arab League paying for everything and sending troops? They want us to do their dirty work with no involvement by themselves!

The Arab League stated that it wants nothing to do with an attack on Syria, but they want us to attack.Are our leaders insane or just stupid

It is truly amateur hour at the White House - and this is why we should not be doing the "war thing" right now!

@akmackey So true!

President Obama's weakness and indecision may have saved us from doing a horrible and very costly (in more ways than money) attack on Syria!

@BrandiHarmon Good luck.

@BBPACK You have real talent!

"@Ethan738: @realDonaldTrump just bought some beautiful Trump cuff links " Great!

"@danconiapm: @realDonaldTrump he's no Churchill." He might not even be Jimmy Carter!

"@PolitixChick: Just from reading his tweets, it seems like @realDonaldTrump could run our country much better than our President right now.

Did anyone notice that Obama failed to get a coalition of other countries to go along with us. He couldn't even get Britain! NO LEADERSHIP.

@AveyahDoesWatch Thank you.

Be prepared, there is a small chance that our horrendous leadership could unknowingly lead us into World War III.

China is already preparing to benefit economically from this mess. They will pick up the pieces and make yet another fortune-& laugh at us!

Obama now just wants to save face, Russia is now telling him "don't do it". He waited too long and the other side is much better prepared.

Who are our generals that are allowing this fiasco to happen right before our eyes. Call it the "PLENTY OF NOTICE WAR"

Syria has prepared for an attack based on all of our "talk" - they have moved targeted ammunition and supplies to new locations.Amazing!

For the first time in the history of military operations a country has broadcast what, when and where they will be doing in a future attack!

The President must get Congressional approval before attacking Syria-big mistake if he does not!

"@Joe1sPro: @realDonaldTrump the president of Syria is killing people inhumanly" But the so called "rebels" may be just as bad (or worse)!

"@kingsfansouth: @realDonaldTrump I usually agree with you, not tonight. Stop criticizing The President."I will when he makes good decisions

How bad has our "leader" made us look on Syria. Stay out of Syria, we don't have the leadership to win wars or even strategize.

If Obama attacks Syria and innocent civilians are hurt and killed, he and the U.S. will look very bad!

Is everyone seeing how incompetently our country is being run by watching the mess with Syria? Our leaders don't know what they are doing!

The ratings of The Cycle on MSNBC, a sad and pathetic show, are way down. If they fired racist moron @Toure , a truly stupid guy, they live!

@tanjas_world Tanja--never give up!

The United States needs to fix its own problems, of which there are many, first!

Let the Arab League take care of Syria. Why are these rich Arab countries not paying us for the tremendous cost of such an attack?

If we are going to continue to be stupid and go into Syria (watch Russia), as they say in the movies, SHOOT FIRST AND TALK LATER!

I wonder what the great generals like Patton, the big M, or Robert E. LEE would have thought about our stupid broadcasting of an attack?

@walaa_3ssaf No, dopey, I would not go into Syria, but if I did it would be by surprise and not blurted all over the media like fools.

That said, the rich Arab countries should get involved with the Syrian mess, not us.We should start rebuilding our own country & military.

Why do we keep broadcasting when we are going to attack Syria. Why can't we just be quiet and, if we attack at all, catch them by surprise?

I give the President's speech a 7 on the scale of 0 to 10! Not bad but room for improvement!

Why would anyone think Obama would attack Syria the day of his speech in Washington. He doesn't want to detract from his press & glory.

. @FoxNews legal analyst & former prosecutor @kimguilfoyle destroyed hack Schneiderman’s suit on @FNTheFive yesterday.She’s very sharp!

There has been a systematic targeting of the Tea Party by the Obama administration. Now Schneiderman goes after me. No coincidence.

The lightweight hack Schneiderman told Ivanka that the “case is weak" and more. Meets with Obama & then files one day later.

Has AG Schneiderman been extorting his targets and their lawyers for contributions? We will find out.

@ElmarosuElvin Thank you.

@TuleTwilight Interesting!

@MichaelPMulhall @CNBC I don't think he can!

Why isn’t AG Schneiderman going after Democrat Jon Corzine and the $1.4 billion that is “missing?”

Amazing! AG Schneiderman sues a school w/ a 98% approval rating but doesn’t go after billion $ fraudsters all over Wall St.

I really enjoyed doing the show circuit this AM discussing lightweight AG Eric Schneiderman & the terrible job he has done for NY.

Gov. Cuomo's Moreland Comm should be looking at AG Schneiderman shaking down those under investigation/ in litigation for campaign $$$

Wow, l just found out that A.G. Schneiderman met with President Obama in Syracuse on Thursday --- and sued me on Saturday! Same as IRS etc.

"@Doanertouque: @realDonaldTrump the last ag was publicity oriented too...client #9." But much smarter than Schneiderman!

"@Chowes247: @realDonaldTrump Corzine is a evil schemer who stole 1.4 billion. Trump starts a University to help people get rich & he's bad!

What did our very stupid & ineffective A.G. Eric Schneidean, during his trips to MY office, tell me about President Obama & Governor Cuomo?

After years of long stops then starts, why did dopey Eric Scheiderman tell people in The Trump Org. "this case is going away,we have no case

How can an Attorney General ask for campaign contributions during his evaluation of a case - a total sleazebag!

Why did lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman come to my office on numerous occasions begging for campaign contributions? Also, recent asks?

Why is it that Eric Schneiderman is considered a lightweight by so many and has failed to go after Jon Corzine and big abusers for billions?

Why did failing A.G. Eric Schneiderman, after years of looking, file his pathetic lawsuit on a SATURDAY afternoon (unheard of)? No case!

Lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman, who has been a total failure in office, failed to report the 98% approval rating of students for courses

I will be on Greta @gretawire tonight at 10 PM on Fox News.

Re @TWC TimeWarner, I am going to be switching many of my buildings to another service—this is ridiculous!

I missed the PGA Championship because it was not broadcast by TimeWarner @TWC . Why aren’t they giving subscribers major discounts?

First Minister @AlexSalmond will be destroying the beauty of Scotland with his insane desire for bird killing wind turbines.

. @AlexSalmond is making a truly stupid mistake by forcing ugly industrial wind turbines down Scotland’s throat –he's hated for it.

If the gov't shuts down, it is because Obama wants to make working Americans buy ObamaCare while businesses and gov't are exempt.

FACT – the reason why Americans have to worry about a government shutdown is because Obama refuses to pass a budget.

Re: hiring contractors, remember the cheapest isn't always the best. Their work may have to be redone & they may not be reliable.

How did Snowden, with not even a high school education, get access to top secret U.S. records. He then gave, or sold, those records-traitor!

"@Zaranawabzadi: @realDonaldTrump @Jahbalon Trust me its been a while we saw an American as a president. i am for Sir Donald"

@Rogerjmunson Only 40 hours? (just kidding).

Can you imagine not taking Snowden's passport away before he jetted happily away to foreign lands (where he gave away many U.S. secrets).

Keep difficulties in perspective. Ask yourself "is this a blip or is it a catastrophe?"

Putin re Snowden issue “it is like shearing a pig: there’s lots of squealing and little fleece.”

Call it any way you like, but Snowden is a traitor. When our country was great do you know what we did to traitors?

Re negotiation: Trust your instincts even after you've honed your skills. They're there for a reason.

Negotiation is persuasion more than power. Negotiation includes a lot of fine lines--and that's what makes it an art.

Our debt is about to reach $17T. Iraq has $20T in oil reserves. Interesting.

"@Lisa_LuciaTesta: @realDonaldTrump I'm sure you didn't. There are a lot of sickos out there!" That's for sure!

Who would really believe I would say such a thing about a guy I truly liked, James Gandolfini. Sadly, very sick people use my name.

I never made the ridiculous comment about James G. and Obama Care - somebody else put it out and attributed it to me. Not my style!

Keep testing your limits. Never become complacent. Always think big!

All I can say is that if I were President, Snowden would have already been returned to the U.S. (by their fastest jet) and with an apology!

Snowden is doing great damage to our relations with other countries and U.S.prestige. China is laughing at us as he continues illegal action

Snowden is sitting in China and taunting the U.S. He is mocking us as a Country. Great time to place a tax on China trade if not turned over

Like it or not, haters and losers, everybody is talking about Miss U.S.A. and Miss Utah. By the way she is a fine young woman-unfair to her.

Frankly, for a writer, I don’t think @DannyZuker ’s stuff is good. In fact, it’s terrible.

I own @DannyZuker , but he has his friends & haters & losers tweeting that he beat me. He can’t beat me at anything!

A country that does not control or respect its own borders is a country destined for failure. Secure our borders!

"@dblsolo700: @zed_crtr @realDonaldTrump ASK HIM ABOUT #CP5 CENTRAL PARK 5" Yea, ask me about the muggers!

Likewise, the primary victims of violent crimes are in the African American and Hispanic communities. These people want LAW AND ORDER now!

When it comes to violent crime, and if we are going to solve the problem, we must stop being so politically correct-must tell it like it is!

Sadly, the overwhelming amount of violent crime in our major cities is committed by blacks and hispanics-a tough subject-must be discussed.

I commend Roger Ailes for publicly supporting @FoxNews ’ employees against the Obama administration's intimidation of its reporters.

Who would be stupid enough to invest in @VattenfallGroup 's ill-conceived windfarm when it will lose £25M yearly?

Additionally, two executives @VattenfallGroup are under major investigation & they are unable to get the many permits necessary.

. @VattenfallGroup , lead investor in Aberdeen windfarm fiasco, has dropped out—project not economically viable--& protestors hate it.

We spend billions of dollars helping nations all over the World but with hurricane Sandy and Oklahoma tornado not one nation helped us!

"@Smerwickman: @realDonaldTrump Iraq was a mistake but how was Obama responsible? He should have and could have gotten out much sooner!

"@GangsterDannyG1: @realDonaldTrump What was Bush and Obama's biggest mistake." The lives and $1.5 trillion spent on Iraq-which is failing.

I like John McCain but we have to start rebuilding the United States instead of countries who hate us and want us to fail - be smart!

Why is Senator John McCain in Syria visiting with the rebels- MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

@Travianno Thanks!

"@Mattia_Crovini: @realDonaldTrump what do you think about italy? I don't think about Italy!

@DannyZuker on your best day you can't come close to beating me, I'll kick your ass every time-take the bet Danny (check with M.F. boss).

@allidoisowen Thanks!

"@Chixbeach: @realDonaldTrump @Matteo5anchez Mr Trump why do you engage these dumb ass people? You're SO much better then any of them!" FUN!

@bvogel56 I never went bankrupt - just like Buffett, Icahn, Kravis and Paulson - as you know!

"@DominicFormaro: @realDonaldTrump it's hilarious to see all these dumbasses hating on you. I bet it feels good to laugh at them.

If @DannyZuker competed against me and.won (which not too many people do), he could win millions of $'s for himself or his charity!

The lawyer I just beat in Chicago was a buffoon but was a lot smarter and sharper than @DannyZuker . Come on Danny, make the bet!

@DannyZuker is a weak and ineffective guy with a long string of failed shows who got his ass kicked last night.He's afraid to make the wager

@TheRealKurse Thank you, I was dealing with a very bad person!

@pusspuss09 Thanks, Country is in trouble.

@DannyZuker everyone is saying you are being beaten badly at this game but you can turn things around quickly if you will go for the deal.

Hope everyone is watching the Finale rerun of Celebrity Apprentice on CNBC-especially the haters and losers! It is on right now.

No @DannyZuker it's making you crazy because you don't have the guts to play the game. Come on Danny, you can do it!

@dannyzuker I hope you pick up a lot of twitter followers by this so people can see what a total asshole you are!

@DannyZuker @AndyRichter Danny, you're not having fun, you are getting your ass kicked - afraid to make the deal?

No @DannyZuker , just the opposite, lots of money can go to charity if you have the guts to play the game (deal)!

Remember, @dannyzuker , you are not even the real "boss" of Modern Family - no big $$$$$$'s for you!

@DannyZuker Come on Danny, are u afraid of the DEAL (be careful, I'm really good at deals).

@DannyZuker Bigger means bigger dummy, you really are stupid, aren't you!

@DannyZuker Another racist remark by you, Danny, are you a racist?

I know you don't like to hear this @DannyZuker but the biggest nights of The Apprentice were far "bigger" than the biggest nights of Mod Fam

@ericleebow Five great golf courses with the new Blue Monster currrently under construction!

Just got final renderings of Trump National Doral in Miami - there will be nothing like it in the Country, will be the best!

@DannyZuker , are you ready for the deal?

@gingram66 Wrong!

@DannyZucker , are you ready for the deal?

@LukewSavage And dumb people like @DannyZucker .

I never heard of @DannyZucker until his very dumb and endless tweets started pouring out of insecure mind-but I have a great deal for him!

I was just told by a television pro thay @DannyZucker is one of the truly dumbest guys in the business-he's obsessed with T-so many flops!

It should be mandatory that all haters and losers use their real name or identification when tweeting - they will no longer be so brave!

@julesmattsson Wrong, totally proved my case but didn't get damages because the libel laws in this Country suck!

@TheJuice59101 I do, thanks.

@ForQ2 Are you making less than minimum wage, don't worry, the government will protect you. Afraid to give your real name? You should be.

@ForQ2 You're nuts, go get a job.

@HatchetWounds Totally wrong dopey.

@JimmyDeVito Thanks Jimmy.

"@CongressGent: @realDonaldTrump is one of the greatest businessmen to ever live. It is impossible to think otherwise." Very nice, thanks!

Great investor John Paulson just sought bankruptcy protection for a unit of his hedge fund-very smart-but he didn't go bankrupt you morons!

Let's see whether or not Chuck Townsend @CondeNastCorp is smart enough to fire Graydon Carter, who only cares about his bad food restaurants

Mrs. Goldberg, who filed the Chicago case many years ago, is a vicious and conniving woman--loved beating her.

Thank you for all of the positive response on my Chicago lawsuit victory yesterday. Most of you saw through the phony age card ploy.

@Triggerracing That sounds great--a bad woman.

@RossWeidner Thank you! (I think)

@BenBradleyABC7 True!

I loved beating these two terrible human beings. I would never recommend that anyone use her lawyer, he is a total loser!

Jury was unanimous after hearing the made up case against my co. Filed many years ago, she.and her pathetic lawyer should pay me big damages

The so called 87 year old "lady" was a vicious and skilled investor who was trying to rip me off with made up facts and a blowhard lawyer.

It's important to remain open to new ideas and new information. Keep your door open every day to something innovative and energizing.

I very much appreciate all of the great reviews & comments on my speech in Michigan--the people were great.

The Lincoln Day Dinner last night in Michigan was fantastic. Record attendance and tremendous enthusiasm- I loved it!

@EMTgoneNUTZ Thanks Tanja

One season ends and another starts. Already casting for the next @ApprenticeNBC . Great news for charity--$13 million so far.

Very sad that Republican donors were targeted by Obama’s IRS.

Isn’t it amazing that Obama “never knew” about the IRS scandals until he saw it in the news?!

@JillToma Hi Amy, see you soon.

@Van_in_DC @DannyZuker Thanks Van--so true.

@christinefox02 See you later.

@dennisrodman @ApprenticeNBC Dennis--you were great--thanks!

@Itsyknowsbest Thanks!

@beverly_buck Great, enjoy the hotel.

Will be doing Fox & Friends at 7 A.M. It never ends (hopefully)!

I love that, in addition to everything else, so much money is raised for such great causes on Celebrity Apprentice-all proud of that!

Last night's live show was so much fun. Congrats to the entire cast, they are all winners! From beginning over $13 million for charity.

"@Thatchers_Child: @piersmorgan @TraceAdkins @pennjillette @realDonaldTrump ... And much better than @Lord_Sugar 's show!" TRUE & THANKS.

@InaMaziarcz Obama put up nothing, zilch!

Ivanka and Joan Rivers will be working hard tonight at the Live Finale - everybody must watch the OPENING at 9.

@subirchowdhury How are you - $5.5 million (a bargain).

The cast for next season looks really good!

@RebaForever58 Yes.

Just left the set of The Apprentice - the live show tonight will be fantastic - and something very big and very different is going to happen

How badly will the Country be hurt by the three scandals and the very poor implementation and cost of Obama Care?

@leebandoni Thanks Lee!

@Lord_Sugar Much more than anybody knows dopey, much more - and it will soon be revealed in detail.

@ToddFouche1 On that I would beat almost everyone!

@GregE_IoM . Only in your weak mind!

@workplayeat Thanks, only the haters disagree!

@CraigHeff I don't, he makes me money!

Why didn't President Obama just go inside when it started raining yesterday - common sense! The two Marines looked very uncomfortable-& wet.

The LIVE FINALE of @ApprenticeNBC is this Sunday at 9/8C. Watch and see who will be the first ever All-Star Celebrity Apprentice.

This Sunday’s LIVE FINALE of @ApprenticeNBC will be tough & nasty. Be sure to watch @pennjillette & @TraceAdkins fight to the finish!

The sexual abuse that is so rampant has, according to generals, greatly weakened our military. They have failed to stop it.

Just in—all efforts to stop sexual abuse in the military have totally failed—in fact, the stoppers have become the abusers.

. @NYMag is a piece of garbage but I think it is very nice & charitable that they employ the no-talent illiterate hack @jonathanchait .

Congratulations to my friend @seanhannity on @hannityshow 1,000th show consecutively #1 in his time slot! Great going!

@CCV77 Thanks, very nice.

Celebrity Apprentice will be LIVE on Sunday at 9 PM (from New York City).Casting has already begun for next season.

In other words, our military has a very big problem!

Unfortunately with some men when the poison kicks in (not me of course) there are no rules or guidelines in the military that will stop them

I was never a fan of Bush 2 FOR MANY REASONS, including the fact that we should never have gone into Iraq but once there, kept the oil! DUMB

Our very stupidly run Country better stop being so "politically correct" or we won't have a Country to run anymore!

Many generals and military leaders are now saying "I told you so!" They say this will have big impact on military strength & national sec.

General says that the Armed Forces will be severely weakened if the large scale rape and sexual abuse problem is not brought under control.

Army officer who led a sexual abuse prevention unit was just fired after being charged with violently going after his wife.What is going on?

America's top Army general has warned of a crisis unless sexual abuse in the military is quickly brought undet control.Forces greatly hurt!

"@jakeklopp24: @realDonaldTrump what's it like to be Donald Trump?" Believe it or not, it ain't easy!

"@MikeMessina_: @realDonaldTrump needs to run for President! He would be the best leader!" Thanks Mike.

@joeypiazza Way less - and you are soooo stupid!

"@ricksmi54256322: @realDonaldTrump i can't wait til ur president the world will be a better place" If I ran and won, so true (& thanks)!

Looks like we will have a pervert running for mayor after all - just what New York City needs - and he will revert back to form, always do!

"@rodmonium91: @realDonaldTrump Is that Zuker character still giving u a hard time? He isn't qualified to shine your shoes!" ANOTHER DOPE!

@Janet_Carswell @samflaherty_ Thanks.

Obama & his people did a brilliant job of delaying these scandals until after the election. Mitt must be going wild thinking about it!

If these scandals happened before the election, Obama could not have won.

@Jared808 @commonguymd @AP True!

@sarah_bales1 True and thanks.

@Roddy_Brown Thanks!

@polotodd804 This is one of the worst made and inaccurate documentaries I have ever seen. Filmmaker Mike Tollin has zero talent.Also-boring

@A_Beil Thanks Andrew.

I wonder what the next scandal will be in D.C.? Can we handle yet another?

The three political disasters could lead to a major and complete political meltdown!

The "lady" in Chicago that I'm fighting owes me $500, 000 and is sophisticated & vicious. She made up a story & plays the "age card" - bad!

@persvanstrom Based on your picture I can see why - you look lost and in need of a cheap lifeline.

@mikeluis93 Mark Cuban is a bully who is physically very soft and therefore should immediately stop wearing T shirts. No strength!

@Lord_Sugar can't hold a.candle to Donald.Trump - he is a laughing stock in Great Britain (but his show pays me lots of money, so I'm happy)

The success of Shark Tank over the years is a total joke compared to the success of The Apprentice, one of the biggest hits in T.V. history.

@african11 But I love insulting people who don't have the goods but think they do!

The Apprentice, on the other hand, has been a MAJOR television hit, often times finishing #1. Even now, after 13 seasons, it wins its slot!

@mcuban is a short ball hitter who had a massive failure on television, The Benefactor. Now he is one of many on a modest ratings show, S T.

@BrianLynch @DurantRandy Thanks, no wonder our Country is in such trouble!

@abaldwin31 Thanks.

People do not assume this but more than anything else, I like helping people. Be at Trump Tower at 11 AM today.

Residential Capital, a company in which Warren Buffett is involved, went bankrupt - but that doesn't mean that Warren Buffett went bankrupt!

I'm giving away money! 11AM Trump Tower. Be there or be left behind!

I would absolutely kill Jon Stewart(?) in a debate - it would be no contest - he's not fast enough or smart enough (only obnoxious enough!).

@SportsWalnuts And Jon Stewart(?) is a very little man hiding behind lot's of high priced writers without which he would be nothing!

Just watched Jon Stewart(?) jumping up and down and screaming like a madman - nothing funny or smart, just loud and obnoxious, a pushy dope!

"@rodmonium91: @realDonaldTrump Any truth to the rumor you bought some of your 2.1mil followers?" No,I'm too cheap!

Wow, I love stimulating debate and driving certain people crazy-the Generals were forced to do something they didn't want to do (not me).

Is it even slightly possible that Jodi Arias could be set free-wow, what a miscarriage of justice that would be!

The jury in the Jodi Arias trial is, believe it or not, still out. You never know but such a long deliberation could be good for the defense

The Generals and top military brass never wanted a mixer but were forced to do it by very dumb politicians who wanted to be politically C!

Keep Wednesday morning free. You will want to see this!

26,000 sexual assaults or rapes reported in military last year-and that is just the number that is reported (many do not want to report).

Sexual assault and rape in the Armed Forces is a Massive problem that nobody wants to talk about or do anything about-the big dark secret!

Head of Air Force's anti-sexual assault unit arrested for sexual assault! It just seems that our Country is not what it used to be.

As I’ve said many times before, Jon Stewart @TheDailyShow is highly overrated.

Jon Stewart @TheDailyShow is a total phony –he should cherish his past—not run from it.

If Jon Stewart is so above it all & legit, why did he change his name from Jonathan Leibowitz? He should be proud of his heritage!

What’s funny about the name “F**kface Von Clownstick” -- it was not coined by Jon Leibowitz-- he stole it from some moron on twitter.

Amazing how the haters & losers keep tweeting the name “F**kface Von Clownstick” like they are so original & like no one else is doing it...

It's crunch time. This Sunday's All-Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC 's task will separate the winners from the losers.

@roysj Unlike you, stupid, I became a big stock market investor a couple of years ago because the dollar is going to hell & false low int.

Turn to QVC now to watch Melania - really good stuff!

Why are some more concerned with granting terrorist rights than protecting innocent Americans?

Our trade deficit is still on pace to be over $500B. This is killing our manufacturing sector and sending jobs overseas.

Call @MELANIATRUMP today on @QVC at 5 PM EST, say hello, and buy buy buy!

My wife, Melania, will be on @QVC today @5 PM selling really beautiful jewelry at a very low price. Perfect for Mother’s Day—call in!

@nikkio True!

@marie_marshallx @ApprenticeNBC Thanks.

@miamarrazza Work really hard & think smart!

@adb1707 @TrumpTowerNY @THEGaryBusey Good point!

With Boston terrorist cell widening in suspects, it's now clear that it was a mistake to read the bomber the Miranda warning so early.

. @chrislhayes replaced @edshow on @msnbc to increase ratings. It’s a shame Chris’ are even worse. Sad to see.

All-Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC is down to the five final contestants. Getting fired now is when it really hurts!

Jodi, if you're listening, MAKE A DEAL!

Jodi should try but the Govt. should not make a deal - no jury could be dumb enough to let her off (but you never know, look at OJ & others)

Jodi Arias has stated that she follows me on twitter so I really hate to be saying that she is guilty but sadly, she is as guilty as it gets

@salefisher - Jordan is great!

@hdiallo Why do you follow me creepy stalker?

@JohnQuinsay When you get bored with others, you'll be back (and don't hurry).

@AxlRose1996 Stephen, that's right...and someone who is really smart!

"@teaparty321: @realDonaldTrump if you run for president in 2016, I hope you talk about your success instead of hiding it." No doubt!

@PatrickMendezNV Great idea - did you see their list, a joke!

Just took a look at Time Magazine-looks really flimsy like a free handout at a parking lot! The sad end is coming-just like Newsweek!

@Drake4444444 I never knew but thanks for the compliment!

@Neviah_M A totally one sided documentary. Why weren't the police, detectives and prosecutors interviewed? City should not settle this case

@CraigSJ Why did they all sign confessions and how many people did they mugg that night in the Park? What about their criminal records?

“Don’t let the fear of striking out hold you back.” – Babe Ruth

Oil should not cost more than $40 a barrel. Ideally it should be $25. Cheap to produce and we protect the OPEC countries.

ObamaCare is a disaster. Americans will see record increases in their premiums and inferior care services.

Upstate New York is suffering with record unemployment. Fracking is the answer. Frack now and Frack fast!

Wow, I just found out that in a major poll of its readers the @NewYorkObserver voted me #1 on the "power 100" list in NY. I disagree, but it's still cool.

Snow and freezing weather all over mid-section of Country. Global warming specialists better start thinking fast!

Money is really cheap so this is a great time to buy a house-but be sure to lock in long term financing (without which don't buy).

Housing prices are up in Feb over last Feb 9.3 per cent -remember, I told everyone two years ago to buy (but they will be going much higher)

@naunie_b sarcasm dummy!

"@ELewie1994: @realDonaldTrump Ever going to return to WWE and have your $$$ fall down from the sky?" Up to Vince M.

@Stiles_Dub @LilJon is a great guy and a great competitor who is respected by all!

"@DeannaSpillyard: @realdonaldtrump You are a very wise man Mr. T! Love your tweets." Thanks.

Once again @LilJon has competed at a very high level on Celebrity All Star @ApprenticeNBC . He is a great competitor.

Congratulations to Michael Jordan on his marriage over the weekend.

. @Lawrence is the poor man's left wing @oreillyfactor (with no ratings)!

@Colvio117 Thanks!

@DannyZuker Night loser!

@JonNeumeister Dopey, I've won them all.

@ShawnGarrett I should have many Emmys for The Apprentice if the process were fair-in any event, it's not my day job. ,

@realDonaldTrump Windfarms destroy everything around them-very sad!

@mtshastacola Happy birthday!

@IvanGH Great taste!

@OMGguy18 Wrong, screen is too small-Samsung size is better.

@VincentYanni I agree, Modern Family sucks!

@FakeBriWilliams Thank you!

@DanielRobinsMD . @Lawrence is a very dumb guy who just doesn't know it-his show is a critical and ratings disaster!

Afghan Leader Karzai has received tens of millions of dollars IN CASH from the U.S. Government- how stupidly is our Country being run?

By Scotland officials canceling my local ad about how damaging wind turbines are- it became a much bigger story around the world. Great!

@SiegristA Thanks!

@harry_vickers @DannyZuker @ApprenticeNBC Thanks!

@richardroeper Keep dreaming!

I just sent @THEGaryBusey a check of $20,000 for his charity, Children's Kawasaki Disease . He worked hard and deserves it.

. @DannyZuker Don't lie, @ApprenticeNBC was #1 in all major demos at 10. Do not lie!

"One hit wonder @DannyZuker ", I notice you are not disputing all of the failures that I said you had. Let's talk about it!

. @DannyZuker I'm in front of the camera and behind the camera- just looked at your picture, you'll never be in front of the camera!

‏. @richardroeper - Perhaps one of the worst replacements in showbiz, once you went on it was over! Your taste sucks!

. @ApprenticeNBC Season 13, still #1 at 10PM in all key demos despite having to serve as our own lead in from 9-10. 11PM News loves Trump!

"Failed show @DannyZuker " season 1 of @apprenticenbc had 28 million viewers and 41.5 million watching but you only want to talk about 10 years later when I still win 10PM in all key demos. @DannyZuker

. @DannyZuker I hear your filmography is "stacked" with failures.

“Failed show @DannyZuker ” I have never heard of you and was told you are a loser-after reading your credits I have no questions about it!

Just out- @ApprenticeNBC was in first place in all demos during the 10PM hour in the ratings.

Doing Fox and Friends at 7.00 A.M. Hope you loved Apprentice last night.

Did you agree with my decision? #CelebApprentice

Mechanical dog is going to be trending tonight. #MechanicalDog #CelebApprentice

Great boardroom. #CelebApprentice

Do you agree with the client's decision? #CelebApprentice

Maybe @THEGaryBusey should stick to words... vs. barking. He’s got a definite talent when he wants to use it. #CelebApprentice

Great memory @TheRealMarilu ! #CelebApprentice

Boardroom time- which team do you think had the best presentation? #CelebApprentice

What did you think of @THEGaryBusey 's mechanical dog idea?

Team Power+ @LilJon = Spielberg? Let’s find out. #CelebApprentice

. @IvankaTrump is right—Plan B has descended into a state of total chaos. #CelebApprentice

. @TraceAdkins says @Joan_Rivers is a gem. I agree. We all agree. #CelebApprentice

. @THEGaryBusey feels he’s been abandoned by his team. Do you think so? #CelebApprentice

Looks like Plan B is stuck with the mechanical dog. @THEGaryBusey has latched on and won’t let go. #CelebApprentice

. @THEGaryBusey doesn’t need instructions. Couch time is more fun. #CelebApprentice

Do you think @THEGaryBusey will be able to “step up” as PM? I know @lisarinna is hoping so. #CelebApprentice

Here’s @Joan_Rivers . She & @IvankaTrump make a terrific team as my advisors. #CelebApprentice

We have the Final Six—and @LilJon is the last remaining member of Team Power. He’s done a great job. #CelebApprentice

"@vanillakissesxx: @realDonaldTrump Love you and love the show!! :)" Thanks S!

@WIBWAriana 9?. Thanks.

"@kwindlan32: Are we going to hear more buseyisms tonight on @CelebApprentice , @realDonaldTrump ?" Yes, big time!

@Core15 Thanks.

@Joan Rivers comes back in a big way tonight on Celebrity Apprentice - she is fantastic. 9 on NBC.

"@abethbyr: Im SO ready for an awesome #allstar @CelebApprentice tonight! Bring it @realDonaldTrump @TraceAdkins @lisarinna @THEGaryBusey "

@DBradleyRI You are a great looking guy who is really smart - you can do much better than your current girlfriend - she's nothing!

I remember when the Apprentice became the number one show on T.V. @tombrokow came up to me and thanked me on behalf of NBC (Yankee Stadium)

Marble mouth @tombrokaw asks "why do we think to have a successful eveving you have to have Donald Trump as your guest of honor?" BORING TOM

Thanks for the tremendous support for my shirts, ties and suits at Macy's. They do great because of really high quality at a low price.

@Anon_Farmer @PeaceLibLady Not me, I predicted the housing bubble and told people not to buy. I now tell people it is a great time to buy

"@lucysmommichele: @realDonaldTrump Gary Busey cracks me up! He definitely has a different outlook on life! Thanks for The Apprentice!" Nice

"@GauravK725: @ForQ2 @realDonaldTrump look at the facts..those millions were made into billions by Mr. Trump. And its still growing!" TRUE!

"@MirandaKroughh: @realDonaldTrump I love you and I think you're funny." Sooooo sweet, thanks!

The Time Magazine list of the 100 Most Influential People is a joke and stunt of a magazine that will, like Newsweek,soon be dead. Bad list!

"@MustardTiger33: @realDonaldTrump - Hey, Mr. Trump, do you like Canada??" Love Canada and its people!

"@ToddZ64: @realDonaldTrump I love it when you are on Letterman. You keep him on his toes. Hope you are on his show again soon." I WILL BE!

"@jTheCollegeKid: @realDonaldTrump @joooooojaah Shut up Trump I'm unfollowing you" Great, but you won't stop loser-you have no control!

"@THEsal_sortino: @realDonaldTrump can a future business man get a follow back or favorite or reply from his biggest role model!" Hello Sal

"@sad__mom: @realDonaldTrump when i watch the clouds all i see is your face and think "success""Wow!

@dogs4peace Very cool!

"@firephoto67: @realDonaldTrump Big fan Mr. Trump, always have been. Keep up the good work" Thanks Woody!

"@joooooojaah: @realDonaldTrump is my favorite twitter account" Thanks!

@masotam Police records, signed confessions and more?

"@Sam_Kotowski: Once again @realDonaldTrump does a great job on Fox News w/ Greta. Run for president! RT I'm a huge fan!!!" Thank you!

What apology, didn't they go around beating the crap out of people and robbing them? Why did they all confess? Aren't police convinced?

@DanScavino Dan-You are a great guy with a great family-amazing future!

@gretawire -I'll be doing On the Record With Greta Van Susteren tonight at 10 P.M. Greta is a Terrific person who really gets it! (FOX).

@JimDaniell30809 @DaveCentrist True!

@Katietennis1223 Thanks, everyone loves it.

@LetsBeckRush A one-sided piece of garbage--and I won--big success for Scotland!

@piano807 Wow!

@HRdiva_NY Thanks.

@AndreasBoos Very true!

@loverofthecross I don't hate him but he made some really bad decisions.

@Mbathani_Inc Much can be done and it would be easy!

@alan_ashe No, they have no guts.

@Nautilus916 True!

“Being true to yourself and your work is an asset. Remember that assets are worth protecting.” – Think Like a Champion

Ignorance is inexcusable; it’s the surest way to fail. No acceptable reason exists for not being well informed.

This Sunday’s All-Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC features the return of @Joan_Rivers . Sunday at 9 PM on @NBC --full 2 hours.

“When you expect things to happen - strangely enough - they do happen.” - J. P. Morgan

Often times being ‘innovative’ is simply putting together pre-existing elements into something new. Be resourceful & expect success.

Get ready for fireworks… @Joan_Rivers & @THEGaryBusey face off in the Board Room this Sunday on All-Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC .

Does Bush’s library have a wing featuring Supreme Court Justice Jon Robert’s ObamaCare ruling? Roberts was his prize appointee!

The Boston terrorist thugs’ mother is also a radical. I am sure she will be granted citizenship shortly.

Study your area of business. All business involves risk, but risk can be reduced when you learn everything you can about what you’re doing.

Can @pennjillette @lisarinna and @THEGaryBusey continue to co-exist? Find out on this Sunday’s Celebrity All-Star @ApprenticeNBC .

To be in charge, you have to take responsibility, you have to instill confidence. It’s like being a conductor--set the tempo.

@frankibe I certainly did--in spades.

@afolasoji So true.

@DbagsLoveMe I will, thanks!

We need another Bush in office about as much as we need Obama to have a 3rd term. No more Bushes!

After tearing W Bush down for 12 years, now the media loves him. Why not? He gave them Obama.

Pervert Alert! Serial sexter @anthonyweiner has promised to use twitter as a “tool.” Parents,make sure your children have him blocked.

Weiner says many more pictures may be out there—this is just what NYC needs, a pervert Mayor.

@mschrock4 I never went bankrupt, you dope!

@Abtheproducer Maybe Obama?

Wow, I’m at 2,200,000 followers but I’d love to get rid of the haters & losers—they’re such a waste of time!

@Ashley33331 True, but the losers don't know that--thanks.

@Debonairo That is true!

@HowardSternJohn @DonaldJTrumpJr No!

@thebageldogs @frankshow @kristinaoakes Thanks--the haters & losers know that too.

Former Weather Underground radical Kathy Boudin spent 22 yrs in prison for armored-car robbery that killed 2 cops & a Brinks guard and now holds an adjunct professorship at Columbia University. Boudin also received an academic laurel from NYU Law School What is wrong with this story? Isn’t this just ridiculous? Terrible! #KathyBoudin 

"@DaveCentrist: @realDonaldTrump The most over-rated person on the planet, Donald J. Trump. Except by himself. Why do you follow loser?

@GauravK725 Thanks.

@DurantRandy Thanks.

@pokerswayne Wrong on all counts dopey-you forgot to say taller than me!

@TheSportsSwede You are so stupid!

@daytradersfx That is true.

@TatorJuice Wow, so nice! Thanks, I wish I could have met him.

"@NearBatman: @realDonaldTrump You aRe my favoUrite! Someday U Could be prez. How About a rt Good luck.

"@NeilWhinhamPGA: @RealDonaldTrump If you were a Golf Professional where in the world would you set up your business?" Doral in Miami.

@HayJayP26 Work hard!

. @VattenfallGroup doesn’t have the finances or financial statement to build the hated windfarm in Aberdeen.

. @VattenfallGroup had no answers at demonstration last night. It’s a failing company. Aberdeen windmills will destroy it.

The sub-station in Blackdog is very dangerous on unregulated landfill—fire hazard! @AlexSalmond @pressjournal

The Council is concerned over the health & safety for the village of Blackdog w/ placement of sub-station. @AlexSalmond @pressjournal

The Council was shocked by the exuberance of the demonstration in Blackdog. @AlexSalmond @pressjournal

The entire village of Blackdog in Scotland protested to the Council last night about the ugly windmills. @AlexSalmond @pressjournal

@Chadillac107 True and thanks!

“The aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through.” - Steve Jobs

I believe Lance Armstrong had death wish when he did interview w/Oprah—as I predicted, everybody is suing him, he’ll have nothing left

@Tokodi1 See Trump Tower!

@DPMurphy93 That's true--they all ask!

By rejecting my ad on ugly windmills & @AlexSalmond ’s faulty thinking on the “Lockerbie bomber” the ad is now on worldwide newscasts.

Watch out. Champion @Joan_Rivers returns to the Boardroom as a judge in this week’s All-Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC . Don't cross her!

Can someone explain to me how a Chechnyan permanent resident non-citizen in our country is planning Jihad while on welfare?

Sen. @MaxBaucus has announced his retirement. A major proponent of ObamaCare, Baucus now says it’s a ‘huge train wreck.’

The Boston killer applying today for ObamaCare. He demands that medical bills be taken care of immediately. Does this include dental?

As everybody knows, but the haters & losers refuse to acknowledge, I do not wear a “wig.” My hair may not be perfect but it’s mine.

I promise you that I'm much smarter than Jonathan Leibowitz - I mean Jon Stewart @TheDailyShow . Who, by the way, is totally overrated.

@PhilStephen The Scotland golf course in Aberdeen is open & packed—really cool to see & many are saying the greatest golf course ever built.

@DukeJrII Very sad--thanks.

@wvcarsong Okay, please say hello to her for me.

@GabiRyan1990 Sunday May 19th.

"@Maddie_Rene: @realDonaldTrump trump would be a great president he would be strong and truly fight for the US. freeing up the market.Thanks

The mother of the Boston killers (not suspects) says her boys are totally innocent and were set up-I can see the 14 year long defense now!

Lance Armstrong just got sued by the Federal Government-they want their money back-I told you so! What was he thinking when he did that int?

Scotland does not have free press, even when you are just stating the facts-it's crazy!

@ruralbeeffarmer Big pollution during manufacturing and building process!

"@Fun_Foy: @realDonaldTrump Didn't some other guy admit to actually committing this brutal crime?" Yes, but they committed other attacks!

@RamboFo Great!

@RebeccaErin_ They were viciously attacking other people in the Park-nice guys?

I have many great people but also an amazing number of haters and losers responding to my tweets-why do these lowlifes follow-nothing to do!

@DoroMundo Thanks!

The Central Park Five documentary was a one sided piece of garbage that didn't explain the.horrific crimes of these young men while in park

@bitchforshort Victim never died so they would not have been given death penalty-but did you see what these "innocent" boys were doing?

@GerhardM_com Perhaps, but the Country is in really big trouble! I do love real estate though (and am seriously good at it).

@GinaCHaley They devalue everything, stupid!

@penguin_rob like ugly, bird killing wind turbines!

The Chinese talk of climate change and carbon footprint but don't clean up their factories-but they sell us the equipment to clean up ours!

Wrong, used to be called global warming and when that name didn't work, they deftly changed it to climate change-because it's freezing!

@HelmJoshua Wind turbines will quadruple your electric bills and destroy the value of your home. Lot's of chicken soup however-bird kill.

@jon_fullerton No, the Chinese will make them!

North Carolina’s most exclusive club, @Trump_Charlotte ’s features @SharkGregNorman designed golf course, which fronts the biggest lake in NC

Will @anthonyweiner be fully clothed in his mayoral ads?

Sexting Pervert @anthonyweiner has returned to twitter. Parents of all underage girls should BLOCK him immediately!

Did the Boston terrorists register their guns? No. Another example of why gun control legislation is not the answer!

. @AlexSalmond , don’t worry, my ad will be shown across the world--and it is highly accurate!

This past Sunday’s All-Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC continued to win the key demographic of adults 25-54. An amazing run!

I’ve always been a fan of Steve Jobs, especially after watching Apple stock collapse w/out him – but the yacht he built is truly ugly.

It’s freezing in New York—where the hell is global warming?

“The object of war is not to die for your country but to make the other bastard die for his.” - Gen. George S. Patton

In three years people won’t be building wind turbines anymore - they are obsolete & totally destroy the environment in which they sit.

@jamezypell Yes!

“Attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference.” - Winston Churchill

If your enemies end up liking you it’s because they beat you. You want their respect, not their friendship.

Next time you are waiting in an emergency room remember the Boston killer was rushed to intensive care within minutes of capture.

Will Barack Obama personally read the Boston terrorist his Miranda Rights?

@MarkkCole Happy Birthday Mark.

. @THEGaryBusey survives another week of All Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC . Gary is shifty and playing to win.

In light of Boston, immigration legislation will be much harder to get.

@pjkorman @ClutchBa11er Great wife!

@willowfrantn @BelmontUniv Great!

. @BrandenRoderick did a great job on All Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC . Raised a lot of money for charity while looking great.

The Boston killer will soon be asking for a Presidential pardon—don’t give it to him, Mr. President—hang tough!

The big problem for little @MacMiller is that he’s going to have to have another hit song, not just his Donald Trump bonanza.

. @MacMiller has over 79M hits on YouTube & just hit platinum with his Donald Trump song—screw you Mac!

@TheNordicBroad Thank you.

@RamboFo Thanks.

@jaypeemoney Los Angeles or Scotland!

@Leigh26Heather Savannah, work hard in school!

"@ClutchBa11er: @realDonaldTrump I know you wear mainly Brioni ties. That's wrong, I wear Trump ties that are sold at Macy's.

Me, by a lot!

Will be doing Fox and Friends at 7 A.M. (in 20 minutes).

@jbailey1987 Yes we can oh foolish one, terrorists should not have the right to remain silent!

My ties and shirts are doing very big numbers @Macy 's, beyond my wildest thoughts! Thanks @GoAngelo and the rest of the losers for mentions!

What did you think of the boardroom? #CelebApprentice

George also appeared on Saturday Night Live when I was guest host in 2004. A great time! #CelebApprentice

George Ross and I have done some great real estate deals together. He’s a tough negotiator. #CelebApprentice

Looking forward to @THEGaryBusey 's book of "Buseyisms"!

Romance or Adventure- what do you prefer? #CelebApprentice

For you newcomers, George Ross was one of my first advisors on the original Apprentice. #CelebApprentice

“George has a real twinkle about him” says @TheRealMarilu . Really? The shark should be scared. #CelebApprentice

This assignment has been a challenge to both teams. #CelebApprentice

This assignment has stretched not just the imaginations but the patience quotas of @lisarinna and @pennjillette . #CelebApprentice

George Ross could be right— @THEGaryBusey would be better in the adventure task than the romance task. #CelebApprentice

. @TraceAdkins isn’t excited about their ideas. Are you? #CelebApprentice

. @THEGaryBusey is making no attempt to help. Is he in BuseyLand? Their team is short on help already… #CelebApprentice

How stressed are @lisarinna and @pennjillette already? #CelebApprentice

I hope you are watching the Apprentice...tonight's show is great and Brett Michaels is back!

Everybody loves @bretmichaels ! He’s a great champion and this is where he should be. He agrees!

. @bretmichaels and George Ross are back as advisors. Good to see them! #CelebApprentice

. @TraceAdkins presents the NJ Coast Red Cross a $40,000 check for Sandy Relief. You can tell he’s very pleased about that--& rightly so.

Seems like the teams are surprised when @THEGaryBusey comes back. #CelebApprentice

What do you think of water boarding the Boston killer sometime prior to allowing our doctors to make him well? I suspect he may talk!

Make the Boston killer talk before our doctors make him better. Once he is well he will say, "speak to my lawyers."

Don't forget to watch Celebrity Apprentice tonight at 9pm...you will love it!

I don't know how Al Michaels could have been drunk and arrested on Friday night if he was totally sharp on Saturday morning.

Great sportscaster Al Michaels, a friend of mine, played golf with me on Saturday morning at Trump National, LA. He was in perfect shape!

If the Boston killer applies for Obama Care the paperwork will be too complicated for him to understand!

NO MERCY TO TERRORISTS you dumb bastards!

Can you imagine the Boston killer being lovingly tended to in a hospital room right next to his victims who lost their arms, legs and worse!

Bullshit-Pop gave me knowledge and a relatively small amount of money (split between brothers and sisters) and I built it into over 9 bill.

@CoachClintSwan Tell me, what were they doing in the Park, playing checkers?

Watch Gary B tonight on Celebrity Apprentice-some really crazy things happen!

Getting back to the nicer and more normal parts of life, Celebrity Apprentice is great tonight on NBC at 9. It will be a full two hour show!

@NextLevelStoner Great!

You are right, the media is always offending Donald Trump-they have no limits-but they will do anything not to offend the Boston killer!

I know some of you may think l'm tough and harsh but actually I'm a very compassionate person (with a very high IQ) with strong common sense

Didn't the Boston killer even run over his own brother with a car in order to get away? We are not dealing with an innocent baby here-DEATH

When the stupid people start feeling sorry for the Boston killer and want to release him and give him medals, remember the killings-maimings

I hate when the news media, so afraid to offend anyone, always refers to the BOSTON KILLER as "the suspect".

The shirts and ties at Macy's are so good-beautiful and do so well that guys like the one that sued me wrongly want a piece-l kicked his ass

I just won a big Court decision (N.Y. Post) against some character who claimed I owed him licensing fees on success of my shirts and ties.

Oh no, they are worried that they didn't read the Boston killer his rights and he may have a good legal argument. 12 year case to finish? t

"@DJmikeLNY: @realDonaldTrump Mr. Trump? How can people hate such a brilliant person?" It is hard to believe, isn't it! (Thanks).

@PierceCorey Great going!

Sorry, the best and most beautiful ties and shirts made anywhere and at a really reasonable cost. Also, fragrance is amazing. GO TO MACY'S.

"@Jarius_Rembert: @realDonaldTrump has a lot of haters." Not haters, losers!

@Lumberportal That's great!

"@FilmRod83: @realDonaldTrump What house makes your cologne? I'm going to Macy's to get a few of your ties and cologne! The best!" Thanks!

@cjdew67 Thanks!

"@_ayooPRINCESS: . Many people dislike @realDonaldTrump but the man is the man and I can't lie ." So true!

Great job by the FBI, Boston Police and all others involved-start the trial tonight!

"@jschmeezz23: @realDonaldTrump in my opinion you are the best human being ever!" I like that better-thank you!

Is the Boston killer eligible for Obama Care to bring him back to health?

Read my tweets you dopes-of course he should get a trial-but fast (not a 12 year disaster).

You must be kidding-zero chance he is innocent!

Should be public execution for all to see-you will end this bullshit fast!

"@The_INDYpendent: @realDonaldTrump Maybe Anthony Weiner can serve as editor in chief!" But then @CNN would become X-rated!

Get ALL the info, then quick trial, then death penalty for the Boston killer of innocent children and people! Do not be kind.

. @CNN should stop apologizing for the mistake they made the other day & get back to reporting!

@MarlboroStan You've got it mixed up. Chechnya is not the Czech Republic.

Lots of comments—Do you really believe these two brothers operated alone without influence of others?

The @FBIPressOffice , police & others are doing an amazing job. How genius was it putting together that tape?

These Tsarnaev brothers did not work alone. They had help and assistance from other cell members. Be vigilant and on the lookout.

South African Tourism North America will unveil its new ad campaign “What’s Your BIG 5?” on All-Star @ApprenticeNBC this Sunday.

@lanele123 Thank you.

@joeromes2 Thanks Joe!

"@ILOVEBRITNEY_7: @realDonaldTrump could you run for president ? We need you!" We need someone!

@UnitedContractF Interesting and true.

"@rodmonium91: @realDonaldTrump Best piece of advice u would give to a young businessman?" Work really hard and smart!

"@itsHODAIFA: @realDonaldTrump I wish someday i would be like you! You're my inspiration! Keep up the good work. Thanks!

Thinking small when you could think big limits you in all aspects of your life.

Druggie A-Rod, @MLB ’s biggest fraud, is lucky George Steinbrenner is no longer with us. @Yankees would have voided his contract.

@GauravK725 Great!

@blake1swanson Thanks.

It is terrible that neither Obama, Biden nor Kerry attended Lady Thatcher’s funeral. They would all run to Muslim Brotherhood Morsi’s.

Business is easy. Dealing with people is hard. If you are an entrepreneur, your most important job is to choose who works with you.

The Chinese must still be laughing at Kerry’s trip to China. He got nothing, gave them everything and promised even more.

Had a fantastic time at yesterday’s All-Star @ApprenticeNBC press conference with @StephenBaldwin7 in @TrumpTowerNY .

@KathyLooper Thanks.

Great to see @RedSox win big yesterday. Good for Boston and the country. Yesterday we were all @RedSox fans.

@Y0itsbeau Well, I would make America great again.

@handyrachet Flattery!

@puffy61 @Real_LukasHall Thanks.

@dandeloof @mcuban Wrong--he started it, I finished it!

@MusicByEthan Thank you.

@LUSHPILLAI @TrumpLasVegas Thanks.

@LarryRobertWyat Our country needs a negotiator--we are failing fast!

@BeaumontAnthony Thanks.

"@Real_LukasHall: Starting to follow the Donald has been one of my better decisions lately @realDonaldTrump " That's great!

"@slabrunojr: @realDonaldTrump @anthonyskwiat @QueyNewton Cuban could buy and sell Trump 2x!!" Wrong moron, the opposite times 4.

"@anthonyskwiat: @QueyNewton @realdonaldtrump ya because mark Cuban is an arrogant punk compared to Donald who's a living legend" Thanks!

@ccade937 Thank you.

@DannyOjedaOKC Thanks.

@lesterwge Thank you.

I sure hope the sexting pervert Anthony Weiner runs for mayor. Will be great fun watching him both lose and be humiliated.

Negotiation is persuasion more than power. Be reasonable and flexible, and never let anyone know exactly where you’re coming from.

. @alexsalmond RT @islandbluenose You'll be doing us in scotland a great service if you win. Good Luck.

@adamjackson73 Yes.

The world economy is under deep stress with growth slowing everywhere. Yet crude is over $87/barrel. Should be $25 at the most.

Congratulations to @Boston_Police , @FBIBoston & all emergency first responders & doctors for their excellent work under fire yesterday

@AscotCarRental I know Adam--he's a great player & great guy!

It’s very sad that the administration isn’t sending anyone to Margaret Thatcher’s funeral. She was a big U.S. supporter.

@Yazzeruk Very nice--thanks.

@terryvanburen @TheRealMarilu @ApprenticeNBC . @TheRealMarilu will be happy--she's also a great person.

@oparinde Macy's will be happy--and so am I.

@StockMarket100 It might but there'd be "hell to pay!"

@mrmikeyharrison You will love it!

@emilyplacido @foxandfriends @IvankaTrump Thanks.

@sonoman24 @stephenbaldwin @ApprenticeNBC I was not thrilled but left them in because the show is real.

I’ve known @hardball_chris for a long time & sadly, he gets dumber each & every year--& started from a very low base.

. @hardball_chris Did you forget about Bill Ayers & so many others? You should apologize to all the people you offended yesterday.

. @hardball_chris must have the lowest IQ on television—now telling people that domestic terrorists are from the right.

We must change the laws of our land and seek fair but rapid trials for the perpetrators of terrorist acts (Boston) with harsh punishment!

My heart goes out to the people of Boston on this terrible day!

RT @gatewaypundit : The Trump Hotel Waikiki looks like a lovely resort @realDonaldTrump #Hawaii

. @TheRealMarilu is impressing the All Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC viewers with her continued success on Team Power.

Despite firing @StephenBaldwin7 in last night's All Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC , Stephen had strong overall performance this season

From 10-11 pm, @ApprenticeNBC ranks #1 in 18-49 among ABC,CBS, and NBC. #CelebApprentice

Will be doing Fox and Friends in two minutes!

Do you think I made the right decision? #CelebApprentice

Who do you think is going home? #CelebApprentice

Product integration is very important. #CelebApprentice

I’m impressed -- both teams have produced very entertaining silent films. #CelebApprentice

Great shots of @TrumpTowerNY #CelebApprentice

Do you know how many years @TheRealMarilu starred on Taxi? #CelebApprentice

What is your favorite @THEGaryBusey film? Tonight's short film? Point Break? Lethal Weapon? #CelebApprentice

It's boardroom time! Does anyone miss @OMAROSA ? #CelebApprentice

. @PennJillette and @StephenBaldwin7 's arguments are making the edit room look like the boardroom. #CelebApprentice

Based on the shoots- which silent film do you think will be better? #CelebApprentice

. @pennjillette doesn’t like @StephenBaldwin7 ’s cliché line and Stephen says Penn creeps him out. Do we sense conflict yet? #CelebApprentice

What would you choose- Vampires or Cavemen? #CelebApprentice

“A vampire with a day pass?” We are in @THEGaryBusey land. #CelebApprentice

. @THEGaryBusey as Project Manager... is Team Power in trouble?? #CelebApprentice

It’s true— @dennisrodman gets the comeback of the year award. I didn’t like having to fire him. #CelebApprentice

A lot of comments re @MELANIATRUMP vs. Milania last week. I think spelling has taken on a new significance. #CelebApprentice

Get ready to turn to NBC for CELEBRITY APPRENTICE -- TONIGHT'S SHOW IS GREAT!

"@T_Colello: @realDonaldTrump if you were president Korea wouldn't be messing with us #Trump2016 " 100% correct!

@adamscott - I am really proud of you Adam - I'll see you soon at Trump National Doral!

Great job @AdamScott - you deserve it!

"@mforbes326: Can't wait for Celebrity Apprentice! Let's do this Gary! I hope he wins tonight. @realDonaldTrump "

Make sure to watch Celebrity Apprentice tonight at 9 on NBC. A GREAT SHOW, JUST LIKE THE MASTERS. 9

"@alumadrifter: @realDonaldTrump @gameexpress1 I'm calling it for Jason day" He probably just blew it!

@AdamScott is a great guy and player!

"@trevordebus: @realDonaldTrump Why is Apprentice 2 full hours now? Ratings problems prompt NBC to end the season early? No dope,opposite!

"@Michele_WV: @realDonaldTrump Donald Trump for President. Please " You are too kind!

@tjwacker . Good luck!

"@KingOf_Class: @realDonaldTrump Honestly,you can't find anyone more real than Donald Trump!" A great compliment, thanks!

"@MrAlanR: @realDonaldTrump Donald you rock! #theartofthedeal changed me forever. Thanks" That is really great news, congrats!

Remember, save your evening to watch Celebrity Apprentice tonight at 9 - increased to a full two hours - great episode - watch Gary B.

"@rpm11561: @IvankaTrump your dad's interview, last night with David Letterman, was the best, realest, most genuine sitdown, ever ! Thanks!

South Korea must in some form pay for our help-the U.S. must stop being stupid!

China will extract much from Secretary Kerry and the U:S. in order for them to help us with the North Korea problem-don't let this happen!

"@CoolCanuckChick: @realDonaldTrump I thought China was good with the U.S.?" Only if you want no country left!

Did A Rod really try to buy the papers that would implicate him re. drugs - wow, that would be the end, a disaster!

@VeIvetRose Also true!

Remember, NBC increased Celebrity Apprentice to 2 hours starting this Sunday night at 9 P.M. through end of season-great news for App lovers

Bad break for @TigerWoods -hits a great shot which hits the pin and kicks into the water-gets a bogey on hole with another great shot-Champ!

What a shame that Kobe Bryant was so badly injured last night - a truly great champion who brought the Lakers back from oblivion this year!

"@joshlop17: @realDonaldTrump is a true model, hard work and dedication, money, and attitude << and unsotppable force" Wow, thank you!

Ridiculous that they gave the 14 year old golfer from China a one stroke penalty for slow play at The Masters(see, I can stick up for China)

I am on David Letterman tonight.

@bakerjb19 China will only rule if we let them--or are stupid.

@MannaaEyad I only speak the truth.

Our country should be worried about nuclear control far more than gun control--& that one's not even close!

@LanaH11 @IvankaTrump Thanks.

@dabg3241 Turbines will kill more birds than hunters.

@truckncargirl @piersmorgan True!

@MisterEspinal Thanks, very nice.

@RobertMcCallis3 @AlexSalmond @pressjournal @BBCNews @DanScavino Turbines destroy environments and people.

@Faithable @DanScavino True.

Remember to take time this weekend to relax and regroup. It will pay major dividends for the next week.

My performance from last week on David Letterman @Late_Show will be re-aired tonight at 11:35 PM on CBS.

Where is the President? It is time for him to come on TV and show strength against the repeated threats from North Korea -- and others.

The only American who has met with the North Korean man child is Dennis Rodman. Isn’t that frightening and sad?

China controls North Korea. So now besides cyber hacking us all day, they are using the Norks to taunt us. China is a major threat.

All eyes are on @TigerWoods @The_Masters . He’s in good position!

. @alexsalmond RT @King_Pepp Driving through Indiana and seeing tons of ugly windmills. Now I know what @realDonaldTrump is talking about

. @nbc has increased @ApprenticeNBC to 2 hours until the end of the season--full 2 hour episodes starting at 9 PM EST

"@rodmonium91: @realDonaldTrump I've come to the conclusion the only help for America, is TRUMP 2016 for President!" Probably so!

Don't talk to me about Bush, I was never a defender or a fan!

I can't believe we are not asking South Korea for anything. They make a fortune on us while we spend a fortune defending them-how stupid!

. @Jimmyv3 @WWE Greatly appreciate your nice words re WrestleMania. That’s why you are such a respected writer.

I really liked everyone at the @WWE Hall of Fame ceremony--fantastic people!

I hope everyone (especially the haters and losers) goes to Macy's today and buys some DJT ties, shirts and suits-and SUCCESS Fragrance-love!

Sorry losers and haters, but I LOVED the great energy in Madison Square Garden during my speech. The WWE thought it was incredible - it was!

Why did Vince and the WWE give my speech and segment the most time last night on USA Network - because that's what people want to see!

@thejbrain Thanks!

I just left @trumpwinery in Charlottesville,Virginia --- it is the finest in the country--- really incredible!

Don't negate your own power. Whatever you've been dealt, know you can deal with it. Fear is the opposite of faith.

Think positively. There are always opportunities. Keep your focus and don't give up!

The new reality. ‘China Daily’ is sold in street newspaper vending machines across DC. Why not? They own the place.

Margaret Thatcher was the Iron Lady of the West. She promoted freedom & democracy---a great leader & ally of America.

I am very impressed by @dennisrodman . His return to this season’s @ApprenticeNBC showed who Dennis really is--which is very good.

Thanks @WWE -- @VinceMcMahon is an amazing guy.

. @MELANIATRUMP just finished being on @theviewtv --by any standard, she was great!

@angie_ncislover Have a happy one!

. @melaniatrump will be on @theviewtv today at 11am ET discussing @apprenticenbc #celebapprentice & her skin care collection. Tune in!

I’m a star maker- Adrian has continued to receive many fans in @TrumpTowerNY and @AmandaTMiller is definitely on the map! #CelebApprentice

The boardroom and @WrestleMania - I'm watching great entertainment tonight! #CelebApprentice

What do you think so far? #CelebApprentice

It appears that @THEGaryBusey is entranced with @MELANIATRUMP - and rightly so! #CelebApprentice

. @pennjillette and @dennisrodman as PM’s- I’m proud of Dennis and his performance this season. #CelebApprentice

The #CelebApprentice post @OMAROSA . Will it ever be the same?

My wife, the beautiful @MELANIATRUMP will be appearing… #CelebApprentice

I’m at @WrestleMania tonight but will be doing a few tweets. I know the episode well.... #CelebApprentice

Dennis Rodman is a project manager tonight on Celebrity Apprentice - watch Dennis in full action!

@ApprenticeNBC is great tonight and stars the legendary beauty @MELANIATRUMP who reveals her great skin care collection. @lordandtaylor

: @realDonaldTrump @HelpUServe When we have people eating out of trash cans in this country, we have no business helping any other country"

Starting next week, and by popular demand (plus good ratings) NBC will broadcast only two hour episodes of Celebrity Apprentice at 9 P.M.

Celebrity Apprentice is rebroadcasting last weeks episode at 9 P.M. WITH A GREAT NEW EPISODE FEATURING @MELANIA TRUMP AT 10 P.M. - AMAZING!

My induction last night at Madison Square Garden into the WWE Hall of Fame was amazing-I met some great people, including Bruno.

"@IronMan1021: I think after watching his roast I've realized that @realDonaldTrump is super fucking bad ass Props to you sir" True - thanks

True, America is rapidly losing it's SPIRIT, and when that's gone, we will only be going in one direction - and that direction is down!

"@waggles71: Taking the risk of failure to produce #success . #business #life @realDonaldTrump " Absolutely - that's the way it works!

"@therealHamzeh: One of my idols @realDonaldTrump " A geeat compliment - Thank you!

China is pushing North Korea!

When is South Korea going to start paying us for the massive amounts of money we are spending to protect them from the North?

Our President must be very careful with the 28 year old wack job in North Korea. At some point we may have to get very tough-blatant threats

@BillLMU Lili will call you - thanks and good luck!

I'm getting ready to be inducted tonight into the WWE Hall of Fame at Madison Square Garden - a great honor for me and the Trump family!

@RicardoHernanG Great going Ricardo!

Sunday night at 9 PM EST will be re-run of last week's episode of Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC , followed by new episode at 10 PM.

This Sunday’s All-Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC has the most beautiful boardroom judges ever w/ @IvankaTrump & @MELANIATRUMP together!

Only 88,000 jobs were added this past March. Prediction was 190,000. Businesses can’t expand with Obama Care & high taxes on horizon.

James Holmes, the Aurora, Colorado guy who killed 12 people & injured 58 others, is fighting hard to avoid the death penalty Who says the death penalty is not a deterrent? 

Tell me, which is “cooler”—my induction into the @WWE Hall of Fame or my Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame?

Very exciting—tomorrow night at Madison Square Garden I get inducted into the @WWE Hall of Fame.

Jobs report is really bad - beyond the worst projections.A bad day on Wall Street!

"@Mr_Asuaiko: one day i'll be rich and powerful like my mentor @realDonaldTrump " Great!

Word is spreading that I got a tattoo - no way, I am not a fan!

"@rodmonium91: @realDonaldTrump Will the Mavs make the playoffs, what do u think Mr Trump?" No, Mark Cuban is a loser!

North Korea can't survive, or even eat, without the help of China. China could solve this problem with one phone call-they love taunting us!

I have gotten to know many Spanish speaking people as the owner of Trump National Doral in Miami. They are smart, hard working and great

"@JAW44444: @realDonaldTrump best season of @CelebApprentice yet! Great television! :-)"

Your work will never be in vain if you work for a cause that is greater than yourself.

Looking forward to @VinceMcMahon inducting me into @WWE Hall of Fame this Saturday in @TheGarden . #WWEHOF #WrestleMania

The haters and losers that assume I was a non-athlete and know nothing about coaches should look into my past-unlike our President-open book

I played football and baseball, sorry, but said to be the best bball player in N.Y. State-ask coach Ted Dobias-said best he ever coached.

The basketball coach at Rutgers looks bad but I had a coach who made him look like a baby - coaches can be tough!

I ask again, how much is very wealthy South Korea paying the United States for protecting it against North Korea?

I think it was terrible that Tim Cook of Apple apologized to China. What the hell is he apologizing for? Steve Jobs wouldn’t.

In this time of economic turmoil where millions of Americans are unemployed, our tax dollars are paying @BillMoyers ' big @PBS salary!

I look forward to Saturday night and being inducted into the @WWE Hall of Fame.

The Yuan hit another record high against the Dollar. China is laughing at our expense.

China has control over North Korea!

With the impending crisis in Korea, is it a big confidence builder that Chuck Hagel is Sec. of Defense? Elections have consequences.

Be passionate. If you love what you're doing, success will follow.

Set the bar high, do the best you possibly can, and believe in yourself—because if you don’t, no one else will either.

In the 10:30 PM ET lead-in to local news, @ApprenticeNBC delivered a 31 percent margin of victory among ABC, CBS and NBC in the key news demo of adults "Apprentice" was #1 among ABC, CBS and NBC from 10:30-11 p.m. in all key demos (adults, men and women 18-34, 18-49 and 25-54)- Nielsen.

The @Yankees should immediately stop paying A-Rod—he signed his contract without telling them he was a druggie.

A-Rod’s salary is more than the entire @astros . Half the players on @astros will have better seasons than him. A-Rod is a joke!

Are you expanding your business? Interview returning soldiers. Give them strong consideration. Their sacrifices deserve it.

The only place where our "border" is protected is from Europeans. We educate them in our finest institutions & then have them deported.

Immigration reform is all risk for the @GOP . Their base doesn’t want it and the 12M illegals will all vote Democrat.

I hope everyone, or rather almost everyone, had a GREAT EASTER! We need our leaders to make great and wise decisions in these troubled times

So, what will happen to the Big O on Celebrity Apprentice tonight. Remember, I only fire people when it is deserved, not for other reasons!

BIG NIGHT on Celebrity Apprentice tonight. IMPORTANT, starts at 10 P.M. as scheduled but NBC just increased all future episodes to 2 hours!

Have a GREAT EASTER, I love you all!

No, I'm saying that the World is paying the price for China's pollution while they make a fortune with their dirty factories! Very sad.

Major article in New York Times today discusses the cost of environmental damage in China and how it is RAPIDLY GROWNG! Rest of World pays.

China is the biggest environmental polluter in the World, by far. They do nothing to clean up their factories and laugh at our stupidity!

We have tremendous economic power over China if our leaders knew how to use it, which they don't! China's economy would collapse without us.

"@kaiser1859: @realDonaldTrump what is the solution Mr Trump?" LEADERSHIP!

What do we get from our economic competitor South Korea for the tremendous cost of protecting them from North Korea? - NOTHING!

North Korea is reliant on China. China could solve this problem easily if they wanted to but they have no respect for our leaders.

@gramma421 Not recent, long term support for the autism community.

@GenaLeeNolin Thank you GLN!

Have a great Good Friday and a Happy Easter.

Find out who and what is the best in your field. Identify the trendsetters, leaders and authorities. Learn the standards they follow.

Achievers go for the challenge, so the next deal is what they're thinking about. They have an obligation to best themselves.

Wisdom comes as a result of both experience and knowledge. It's something you can't teach someone else--you have to achieve it on your own.

@NYMag - New York Magazine sucks - lifeless and dead - one of the most boring out there. Get it now, it won't last long!

Adam Moss, editor in chief of @NYMag is quickly losing his reputation in that @NYMag has become so boring and so irrelevant.

Employees of @NYMag should have their resumes updated. It is very boring & will die in the near future. How much are they losing now?

Practice positive thinking—this will keep you focused while weeding out anything that is unnecessary, negative or detrimental At the same time, go through a worst-case scenario but keep it short. Focus on your goal—look at the solution, not the problem. 

@BeaumontAnthony Thanks Anthony.

@Markyoungco @AlexSalmond @pressjournal @JohnDuthie1

. @alexsalmond @pressjournal RT @JohnDuthie1 just sitting here looking out over Aberdeen bay. These clowns cannot be allowed to build a wind farm and destroy this view!

. @alexsalmond @pressjournal RT @djkevritch im proud to be scottish, but bonnie scotland will soon be a thing of the past w/ these windmills

. @alexsalmond @pressjournal RT @GailLorene Ask our Canadian neighbors who abhor the windfarms. And poor Scotland

@slainsview Blackdog folks are very smart--their home values & lives will be destroyed.

@dbpresswire @Late_Show I hope so!

@jessilin02 Fantastic food--thanks.

@spewrange Thanks-- @HowardStern is great!

@CreelKen Hope I do well!

@BrocktonConwell Great! Thanks.

Getting ready to do the David Letterman @Late_Show tonight—I hope you all will watch—I think!

Aberdeenshire coast is spectacular. Its historic value & wildlife will be tarnished if these wind turbines are built--but they won't be!

To all journalists, look into the financial dealings of Scottish Parliament members with Vattenfall…Follow the money.

Less than two weeks until @WWE ’s @WrestleMania XXIX. @TheRock v. @JohnCena willbe epic! Excited to be inducted into the Hall of Fame.

. @EricTrumpFdn continues to do important work for @StJude Children’s Research Hospital. I am very proud of @EricTrump 's philanthropy.

@JNorr11 Yes--and thanks.

@nashvillebobby Thanks Bobby.

@MisterMcFlee Thanks--and good luck!

@thedealszone @washtimes Thank you.

@SmallTwnBigNews Kate--All my best wishes to you.

@TheMayorMatt Interesting and often true!

. @pennjillette is an extraordinary entertainer & magician whose star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is long overdue. Very proud of him.

Congrats to fantastic All-Star @ApprenticeNBC celebrity & illusionist @pennjillette on being honored at 2013 Hollywood Walk of Fame!

The developer of the Scottish wind monstrosities, Vattenfall, just laid off 2,500 people & has serious financial difficulties.

General Petraeus should stop apologising and get on with his life. He is a good man and should have a great future.

The new selection of ties, shirts and suits at Macy's is amazing - also available in Trump Tower lobby.

I'm doing The David Letterman Show tonight -should be interesting!

@GenaLeeNolin Great - call me, we'll get you on!

Great piece on Extra tonight re. Celebrity Apprentice!

Sometimes we do things to build up experience and stamina to prepare, but it's to prepare us for something bigger.

Many of @TigerWoods ’ ‘friends’ were quick to abandon him in his time of crisis. Now Tiger knows who he can count on.

Many people look at successful people & don't see anything but the end result. They don't see all the work that went into getting there.

When somebody challenges you, fight back -- be tough!

When someone can discourage you, you probably aren't determined enough. Be resolute. That's what it takes to get things done.

@SeanHooligan6 @AlexSalmond This is from someone who knows they are a disaster.

The Scottish windfarm was conceived by the same mind that released terrorist al-Megrahi for humanitarian reasons. ..

…al-Megrahi was the man who blew up Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.

@UberBurgers Trump National Golf Club Los Angeles.

@Javi8104 Great--good luck.

@SamRyzen Thank you!

The radar, defense, shipping and civil aviation problems will stop the ugly windfarm. #EOWDC

The windfarm approval in Scotland is subject to many conditions that can never be met - will be tied up in courts for years! #EOWDC

. @TigerWoods has made a truly great comeback - he is number one again! Give him credit, comebacks are tough to do. Way to go Tiger.

For all of my many Jewish friends, Happy Passover.

Cyprus is seizing private bank accounts as collateral for €10bn bail-out. We owe $17T. Think it can’t happen here?

@jacob_mastro You may be right!

@DickDarkey @piersmorgan @ApprenticeNBC Watch next week!

@michellemalkin 2 decades in the conservative movement and look where the conservatives are now--you're fired!

@AgostinelliNick @DonaldJTrumpJr Very nice, thanks.

@hollywood74 Thank you Nadine!

@AimeeTruchan @ABFalecbaldwin @StephenBaldwin7 She is a fabulous woman!

@disneycuty @StephenBaldwin7 Thanks Jennifer.

They changed the name from “global warming” to “climate change” after the term global warming just wasn’t working (it was too cold)!

It’s springtime and it just started snowing in NYC. What is going on with global warming?

Uh oh… @OMAROSA & @piersmorgan once again reunite in the Board Room in next week’s ‘All-Star’ @ApprenticeNBC . Fireworks!

Last night’s All-Star @ApprenticeNBC once again showed why the ultimate onus lies with the project manager. The buck stops there.

What did you think of my decision? #CelebApprentice

Adrian also gives autographs if you stop by the lobby of @TrumpTowerNY . #CelebApprentice

That’s Adrian in the elevator— he works at @TrumpTowerNY & he’s got a lot of stories. #CelebApprentice

People ask about @AmandaTMiller . She is actually a VP of Marketing at the Trump Organization. #CelebApprentice

Who are your favorites on Team Power? Team Plan B? #CelebApprentice

What team would you choose to win? #CelebApprentice

Let’s see what happens in the boardroom… #CelebApprentice

. @DennisRodman is always hard to miss-especially when dressed in silver finery. But not sure about the silver lipstick. #CelebApprentice

. @Joan_Rivers —I know you’re watching- what did you think of your impersonator?

They should have got Darrell Hammond as the Donald Trump impersonator. #CelebApprentice

With @TraceAdkins on top of the truck the crowd definitely buzzed. #CelebApprentice

What do you think of @DennisRodman ’s Donald Trump head? The hair’s not quite right, for one thing. #CelebApprentice

. @Omarosa admitting she’s a threat in the boardroom- that’s not revelation knowledge. #CelebApprentice

. @StephenBaldwin7 thinks @TheRealMarilu is ping-ponging all over the place. Do you agree? #CelebApprentice

Always good to have @ArsenioHall back as advisor as well as @DonaldJTrumpJr . They have their own fan clubs at this point. #CelebApprentice

. @StephenBaldwin7 ’s mother thinks I’m very handsome. Now I see where Stephen and Alec get their smarts. #CelebApprentice

. @LaToyaJackson & @Omarosa are not likely to become friends –ever! #CelebApprentice

Last week’s boardroom was truly epic ---and the dust hasn’t settled yet. #CelebApprentice

I will be tweeting live tonight during Celebrity Apprentice - 9 o'clock on NBC!

Celebrity Apprentice tonight at 9 on NBC - some amazing things happen!

@kumite67 Thanks Brian!

@CharlesRBennett Thank you - a great compliment!

"@JIMHENDLEY81: @realDonaldTrump I agree Donald Please run for president. Your alot smarter than Hillary. America needs you. Thanks!

@philzentz Thanks Phil!

"@hailllluminati: @RealDonaldTrump better run for president in 2016 so i can vote for him. #conservativepride " Thanks!

Wow - they are really killing Jay Leno - let him go out with dignity!

Don't blindly pursue a career that others suggest or insist is right for you. It may be worth taking a pay cut for a job you love.

Looks like the U.S. will be having the coldest March since 1996-global warming anyone?????????

Watching the madness in Cyprus? If our government keeps spending trillion dollar deficits, that could happen here.

This Sunday's All-Star @ApprenticeNBC features some of the biggest fireworks of the entire season. Get ready.

RT @EWErickson : Personally I think it is awesome that @realDonaldTrump listens to @DLoesch on the radio. She's awesome.

@michellemalkin @igo4par True.

. @MichelleMalkin would be nothing without being on the @seanhannity show. I don’t see what Sean sees in her—loser!

@jimmymcgreevy Thanks Jim!

@SharleneH Thank you.

When I think big, which is often, you can be sure I’m aware of the enormous amount of little things that we will have to account for.

@ChrisStackStacy Thank you.

@cbalfer Very nice Chris--thanks!

@Dafny01 Do not give up, keep moving forward.

@jbail33 Yes.

@DavidShuster I don't, but Europeans are being discriminated against--very unfair!

@michellemalkin You were born stupid!

@michellemalkin At least dummy is true!

@1fos1 Pay attention, study more than what is required, keep your focus on the big picture. And good luck.

See yourself as an organization. Pay attention to every facet of your life. What’s strong? What’s weak? What’s missing?

“The difference between stupidity and genius is that genius has its limits.” - Albert Einstein

There won’t be any new gun legislation. No surprise. Americans support the 2nd amendment.

Life always presents new opportunities you would never expect. I hosted @WrestleMania & then I starred in one, which sold most PPVs.

Make no mistake, Obamacare is the first step towards changing our health system into single payer. Just a disaster.

Problem with @GOP is not their message, it’s that they are incapable of controlling the message.

“Here’s something about Donald Trump, he’s got a top rated show on TV and everything he says becomes a headline.”- @DLoesch All true!

Yes, All-Star @ApprenticeNBC contestant @THEGaryBusey is a little out there. But he uses his ‘uniqueness’ to his advantage.

It won’t stay a buyer’s market forever. If you can, take advantage and buy property asap. You’ll thank me!

Remember the golden rule of negotiating: He who has the gold makes the rules.

It’s snowing & freezing in NYC. What the hell ever happened to global warming?

. @mcuban Mark—nice picture, thanks for the invite to the Mavs/Nets game. Next time I’ll go and you’ll win!

@IanRambally Great going!

Celebrity Apprentice on in 5 minutes on CNBC - it's great!

Celebrity Apprentice on CNBC tonight at 9.

The @CelebApprentice will be broadcast tonight on @CNBC at 9 PM.

Haters, stop saying I went bankrupt, it is not so. I never went bankrupt but like many other great business people have used the laws to corporate advantage.

For the haters, out of hundreds of deals or transactions, I have used the bankruptcy laws 4 times in order to cut better deals.

Almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool. Icahn, Kravis, Apollo and most others--but nobody says they went bankrupt!

People buy deals & immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals. It is very effective and a commonly used business tool.

Why do the losers & haters always say I wear a “wig” when they know I don’t. Like it or not, it’s all mine—just ask Barbara Walters.

@MartinFagervik Win!

@RealHotwaffles Thanks.

@chrisr52 Happy Birthday Christine.

@balloon_69 @AFCHaywards Good luck!

@miawesbrooks @dcexaminer Very nice!

@MsCattitude1 @ApprenticeNBC Great and thanks.

@nycal821 @nbc @CelebApprentice Thanks Cheryl.

My shirts, ties & suits (and fragrance, Success) are doing great -- go over & check out Macy’s now—beautiful new selection!

. @OMAROSA is smart and strategic. People should cut her some slack and respect the way she works on @ApprenticeNBC .

@iklemieux @theRealKiyosaki Thanks--and good luck.

@felinemenice Great!

. @WWE ’s @WrestleMania XXIX less than 3 weeks away. Looking forward to being inducted into the Hall of Fame!

@t_thabane Happy Birthday.

The NFL has just barred ball carriers from using helmet as contact. What is happening to the sport? The beginning of the end.

@ChesterStarr @hardball_chris Chester--unreal.

Board Room finale of this week’s All-Star @ApprenticeNBC will leave viewers wondering where the rest of the season goes…It's great!

It’s a shame to hear that the @dcexaminer is failing. No one wants the paper, even if it is being handed out for free.

@FatmaEmadi Thank you.

@jaynielea Thanks Jaynie.

@jcfields13 Thanks Jason.

@yokoono John was great--everybody misses him. Best wishes.

. @NBC just announced that all 1 hour @CelebApprentice episodes are being expanded to 2 hours—it’s amazing what good ratings will do!

I remained strong for @TigerWoods during his difficult period. He rewarded me (and himself) by winning at Trump National Doral.

. @SouthJerseyMag , “According to the Pros” just named Trump National Golf Club, Philadelphia, the #1 private club. Thanks!

. @hardball_chris ’ very small audience is shrinking rapidly because people finally understand that he is very very dumb!

@tinaclean Yes and best wishes.

@CforColby Hi Colby.

10 yrs ago today, the Iraq war began. 4,485 of our nation’s finest have not returned home alive. Iran will soon control Iraq & its oil.

Amnesty is suicide for Republicans.Not one of those 12 million who broke our laws will vote Republican.Obama is laughing at @GOP .

. @RNC report was written by the ruling class of consultants who blew the election. Short on ideas. Just giving excuses to donors.

"One of the most obvious lessons on @ApprenticeNBC is for the candidates to learn to think quickly." - Think Like a Champion

Does anyone remember the fight @mcuban had w/ the referee—he was weak & pathetic—a non-athlete trying to live life thru his players.

Why do shows have @ananavarro —Ntl Hispanic Chair for the losing McCain ’08 & Huntsman ’12. She’s a loser who doesn’t deliver votes.

Sorry folks, but Donald Trump is far richer and much better looking than dopey @mcuban !

@jrkirk22 Thanks.

@BeaumontAnthony Thanks Anthony.

@__Jibz True!

@ilpostio That's why I'll never be Pope!

All-Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC continues to surprise our loyal viewers each and every week. More, and bigger, coming…

It was just announced that @ErinBurnett won’t be going to mornings on CNN. @OutFrontCNN just made a wise decision.

. @SarahPalinUSA did a great job @CPACnews . Much of what she said was plain old "common sense."

. @hardball_chris became a super liberal Obama fan only because he must need the money--and on @MSNBC that’s the way it is.

. @ErinBurnett should have stayed at CNBC—she was never smart, but people liked her. @OutFrontCNN Jeff Zucker’s got problems!

For beauty and flight, I’ll take the @Boeing 757 over the @Boeing 787 any day!

l still think @Boeing should just bite the bullet & get rid of the new batteries in the 787. Those batteries will always be a problem!

I don’t like seeing the Pope standing at the checkout counter (front desk) of a hotel in order to pay his bill. It’s not Pope-like!

. @hardball_chris is a really dumb guy(and I know him well)—that’s why he works swimmingly with our leaders in Washington.

Re: CPAC “The crowd in the main room filled to capacity by the end of Trump’s address, something his operative said he planned to do to help McConnell, who spoke right after him.” @BreitbartNews

I was sorry to decline headlining the Reagan Dinner last Saturday due to a prior business commitment. Pres. Reagan was one of the greats.

. @rushlimbaugh played 3 separate audio bites (the most of anyone) of my CPAC speech. Hour 3 in Friday's show.

Be weak on immigration and ensure Democratic victory.

. @rushlimbaugh is right—the Republicans lost because they weren’t conservative enough—or tough enough.

But @mcuban is physically weak, he has no clubhead speed or game!

@dennizenx Thanks!

@Doyle5sMom Thanks!

@niecey911logan Thanks!

@BillDaley1 True!

. @mcuban is so short off the tee he can't have much of a punch. He's just a weak man with a big mouth!

WHO IS GOING TO GET IRAQ'S OIL???????

Bombings all over Iraq today.That country is falling apart-such a horrible waste of lives and 1.5 trillion dollars (and I told you so!).

@JackVoices You are correct, but he is so easy!

@mcuban is very short off the tee - and his basketball sucks also!

Golf match? I've won 18 Club Championships including this weekend. @mcuban swings like a little girl with no power or talent. Mark's a loser

@KatySutherland6 Great!

@byoppjr We just blew it up dummy!

@ArsenioHall You were fantastic last night on Celebrity Apprentice - everybody loved you!

@DavidMcClain328 Thanks.

"@afielding1984: @realDonaldTrump when you next in Scotland Mr Trump? We miss you!" April and thanks!

"@Ashbash032: @Nautilus916 @realDonaldTrump lucky for me I don't live in America, I live in South Africa..." Bad news, we need you here!

@roannasweet Not even close!

@bearmntn But I like picking on losers!

@borland_jim Great!

@kalevans Great!

@DonaldJChump Stupid, they tried that with The Benefactor and Mark went splat!

@roannasweet Not even close, dopey!

@Cleggermeister Thank you!

@ReederJosh You are right, he is a total joke - his players laugh at him!

@dan_kir96 Dan, because I love beating lowlifes!

@HRdiva_NY Thanks Tanja!

@babyguts666 Thanks!

"@Ashbash032: @realDonaldTrump don't waste time on your haters!Let them hate, you keep building your empire #respect #jealoushaters " Great!

"@n_vranas: @realDonaldTrump @dallasmavs @okcthunder ur a pussy trump @mcuban is way richer than you" Not even close, dummy!

"@LynchZC: @realDonaldTrump I think the real solution here is you running for president! Give it a shot! We need it. Thanks!

“Leverage: don’t make deals without it.” – The Art of the Deal

Is Anthony Weiner also delusional? Add him to NY Sex Offender list instead!

Sexual pervert & deviant Anthony Weiner is polling to see if he can run for NYC Mayor...

. @dallasmavs is 1-12 against the Western Conference’s top four seeds after Sunday’s loss & @okcthunder swept the season series.

Why does @mcuban continue to embarrass the 31-35 & 11TH place @dallasmavs with childish behavior? Really unprofessional!

The Blue Monster is being torn up at Trump @DoralResort . On April 1, I go out & play it one more time until the new course opens.

. @DLoesch played great audio from my @CPACnews press conference on her radio show. Glad she made it!

Scotland will be so lucky if this monstrosity is not built—I will tie them up in courts for years, if necessary.

Vattenfall CEO stated that the company needed to prepare itself for falling electricity demands in coming years-- a changing market.

Vattenfall, the company behind a proposed asinine windfarm off the coast of Aberdeen, Scotland, is having serious financial difficulty.

If @OMAROSA is not in the Board Room, I can’t fire her. @latoyajackson made a strategic mistake.

“All-Star Celebrity Apprentice” ranked #1 for the 10 o’clock hour among ABC, CBS and NBC with a season-high 19% margin.

@Kevin_Johnson68 @trapasso2501 Trump Tower is open to the public.

I will not be commenting on boardroom specifics- would be unfair to the different time zones. #CelebApprentice

True, @THEGaryBusey is a scene stealer without trying. He’s got a gift. #CelebApprentice

. @DennisRodman re @Omarosa is right, she’s becoming predictable.

. @Omarosa is not winning points, being called “the wicked witch of the Mid-West” and most certainly other things. #CelebApprentice

. @Omarosa ’s new name via @DennisRodman : “Ms. Saboteur” sounds rather elegant. #CelebApprentice

. @Omarosa ’s emergency has put a new spin on Team Power’s presentation—but it’s not “show time” yet. #CelebApprentice

. @latoyajackson informs @ArsenioHall that @Omarosa is a “conniving witch”—is he surprised? Are we surprised? #CelebApprentice

“ @OMAROSA is a bit toxic” per @BrandenRoderick . Being a bit PC? #CelebApprentice

There’s no love lost between @latoyajackson & @OMAROSA Disrespectful? Who is being disrespectful? #CelebApprentice

Music cues, audience participation, sounds like a very active Team Power. #CelebApprentice

. @Omarosa on the cover of Soap Opera Digest? That’s a credential… #CelebApprentice

And happy to welcome @ArsenioHall back as an advisor— he will have his own show and is doing great. #CelebApprentice

. @TraceAdkins is back—good news for Plan B. #CelebApprentice

The Paley Center for Media is a great place to visit when you’re in NYC. #CelebApprentice

. @Omarosa has another meltdown … while giving a check for $40,000 to Michael’s charity, the Sue Duncan Center. #CelebApprentice

Great line from @TheGaryBusey : “I am an angel in an earth suit.” Do you agree? #CelebApprentice

. @Omarosa ’s meltdown—was it for real? @DennisRodman thinks she could be an Oscar winner for that performance… #CelebApprentice

"@simonkodousek: You may not agree with @realDonaldTrump , but he knows what's what! Keep being truthful and REAL!" Thanks!

The tournament at Trump National Doral was much more exciting than what is going on now!

"@LinRo_2: Looking forward to the Apprentice tonight.. @realDonaldTrump ..show is still going strong !!!!" Thanks Linda!

I'll be tweeting live tonight starting at 9PM ET re: @ApprenticeNBC . Don't worry other time zones, I will give nothing away!

@ANNIKA59 Annika - Thanks, you are the GREATEST - We all adore you!

"@LinRo_2: Looking forward to the Apprentice tonight.. @realDonaldTrump ..show is still going strong !!!!" Enjoy it Linda!

@shred_session Zero.

Best ratings for the Dateline show were for six months, not two months!

@DeViouSDoLL82 It's Endometriosis Awareness Month-176 million women suffer from this disease.

Just won The Club Championship at Trump International Golf Club in Palm Beach-lots of very good golfers-never easy to win a C.C.

Last weeks Dateline, which I hosted, was the highest rated Dateline since January!

Don't forget to watch Celebrity Apprentice tonight at 9 on NBC - GREAT EPISODE!

Wow-Record ratings for WGC Cadillac Championship at Trump National Doral's Blue Monster-Most watched in seven years. CONGRATS to@Tiger Woods

Huff Post "His early morning speech drew a large crowd, far larger than remarks at the same time on Thursday" and packed by end! The facts.

Thanks for all of the accolades on my speech today - it's all about the truth!

Honest reporters stated that the Prayer Breakfast was going on during my CPAC speech and security was very slow to let people in-long lines!

I agreed to take the worst spot at CPAC because nobody else wanted it and it was the only time I could be there - it was great fun!

WHY CAN'T THE MEDIA TELL THE TRUTH - WE WOULD ALL BE SO MUCH BETTER OFF!

For accurate reporting of my @CPACnews speech, read @PoliticalTicker , @Newsmax_Media, @politico , @HuffPostPol @DailyCaller , @BreitbartNews , @DRUDGE_REPORT & @gatewaypundit .

@jheil at @NYMag is such a pathetic reporter who doesn’t want to know the truth. A total Obama flunky & hack.

Boring & failing @NYMag ’s 3rd rate political reporter @jheil had flunky @DanAmira write a totally false report about me today. He knows I don’t respect him.

I watched the last two minutes of the @dallasmavs game last night--- I just loved watching them lose.

Press conference after CPAC speech this morning was excellent- lots of very professional reporters.

The CPAC speech went really well this morning--- first speaker--- standing ovation. I really enjoyed it.

When you think big, you will automatically trigger more details because details are the major component of making anything big.

"In the general course of human nature, a power over a man's subsistence amounts to a power over his will." - Alexander Hamilton

. @mcuban has less TV persona than any other person I can think of. He’s an arrogant, crude, dope who met some very stupid people. Those stupid people bought @mcuban 's company (of which he owned a piece).

There’s a reason @mcuban ’s partners can’t stand him and on top of that, the team sucks!

CPAC attendees & fellow patriots - lines for my @CPACnews start at 7:00AM outside the Potomac Ballroom. Make sure to get there early!

Really big crowd expected tomorrow morning at #CPAC2013. I look forward to it!

When @mcuban had his own show, The Benefactor, it totally “bombed!”

I love watching dummy @mcuban promote on ok show named Shark Tank—but he is just a small part of that show.

Good move by @MSNBC in downgrading @WeGotEd to a dead weekend spot. This is truly a guy who shouldn't be on tv.

@trader_greg Thanks.

@RickStone1282 @Yankees Thanks Rick.

. @BarbaraJWalters made a great decision in firing @JoyVBehar from @theviewtv . The show will be better without her!

Congratulations to my Catholic friends on the selection of Pope Francis I to lead the Catholic Church. People that know him love him!

To show you how shallow politicians can be, many are jealous of my @CPACnews speaking slot & also their fellow Republicans! Not good!

The DC press corps is obsessed with my @CPACnews speech which is scheduled tomorrow 8:45AM in the Potomac Ballroom. Can't blame them.

Dummy @mcuban made up a story about a visit to Mar-a-Lago last night on Leno. It never happened—I don’t talk that way.

@dennisrodman Thank you Dennis.

Congrats to @EricTrump and @LaraLeaYunaska on a great five years!

I watched Mark Cuban on Jay Leno last night - what a jerk!

Celebrity Apprentice will be rebroadcast tonight at 9 on CNBC.

@kevconnorsespn . Great and good luck!

According to new WPOST-ABC poll, Obama has just lost 14 points on public trust with economy

In making any decision, you need all the facts. But after exhausting all due diligence, in the end you have to go with your gut!

Best of luck to my good friend Derek Jeter on his first game today back at shortstop. @Yankees Captain is a warrior & winner.

@AnnAmplf The Art of the Deal and Think Like a Champion would be helpful.

. @LukeDonald You are so good and so talented that I have no doubt you will conquer the 18th hole at the "New" Blue Monster @DoralResort

. @CPACnews had its largest ever ticket sales the day of my announcement. Really an honor. Can’t wait to see everyone.

The sequester is less than 2% of total 2013 budget. Why can’t the WH re-allocate funds and keep the tours open for children? #OpenOurWH

Lines for my @CPACnews address start at 7:00AM outside the Potomac Ballroom. ACU has asked that you get there early. #CPAC2013

@heyavampirebat Good idea--I wish him luck.

@vcross8 Agreed, they're doing a great job.

It’s sad that the WH is punishing children from across the country by closing all tours. Doesn’t have to be. WH should take my offer.

@msmarjc Thanks Mary.

@hrtbrknomore74 Thanks and good luck.

@karlbstumpf Yes and thanks.

Ashley Judd's candidacy was created by Karl Rove's terrible ads, even before she thought seriously about running. The ads made her look great and now she probably will run.

@gllleymon900000 Thanks Spence.

@WilsonLeeFlores Thanks Wilson.

A note from the fabulous Mark Burnett: “Donald, congratulations again, we are #1 in the 10:00pm hour. I am tweeting about it.”

My @CPACnews speech is scheduled Friday at 8:45AM in the Potomac Ballroom. Will also be telecast live on CSPAN & cable news networks.

Congratulations to @NewYorkObserver on celebrating its 25 year anniversary. Great paper under amazing management!

Glad to hear @ehasselbeck will be staying on @theviewtv . Elizabeth has great presence & doesn’t back down from sharing her views.

All-Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC continues to dominate the Sunday 10PM slot in every key demographic. Still hot after 13 seasons!

Re: Ashley Judd: Keep @KarlRove away. He already made her a viable candidate.

Our economy has had worst recovery under Obama since the Depression. Results of his policies speak for themselves. No new taxes!

. @Graeme_McDowell Great playing this weekend. You are a true winner. We look forward to having you back to Trump National Doral.

Really looking forward to my address @CPACnews this Friday morning at 8:30. Will stress jobs, etc. Can't wait to see my many friends.

According to new employment numbers, 296,000 Americans have dropped out of the work force & gave up looking for work.

Between a terrible press conference, mishandled prisoner swap & Taliban attacks, Hagel's 1st trip as SOD was a disaster. No surprise.

Yesterday’s @cadillacchamp results show Trump @DoralResort ’s course was already difficult. Will be the best after $250M renovations.

. @deesnider is a great guy & a total winner! He understood - he did not leave me any other choice. Look forward to keeping in touch.

@BrandenRoderick Brande-- Thank you! You have been a pleasure to work with.

To @TigerWoods He is truly a great champion and we were honored to have him at Trump National Doral. @DoralResort #Trump

The losing team is now back in boardroom. I can't discuss the team members or what's going on or what happens from here on out.

Re my hair-Should I change it? What do you think?

It's true... Dennis is really into this-very animated. I have never seen him this way before.

Which team is your favorite?

Re Omarosa: Nasty, tough or smart...or all?

Does anyone agree with Marilu that Gary, while 'adorable', is a distraction?

Omarosa is very confident that the execs loved her concept & presentation.

That's an interesting talent that Marilu possesses!

Next she says she's being set up by Omarosa to fail....is somebody confused?

What?! LaToya is saying Omarosa is one of the nicest people she's met?

On the whole, the teams seem to be working well together. No wars...yet.

Gary as the Cat in the Hat? He can work it out.

What do you think of Gary's definition of f-u-n?

Trace delivers check to hospital in NYC: American Red Cross must be grateful to Trace and his team for their tremendous work.

Honest Omarosa: she won't backstab-she'll come at you from the front.

Which team do you think has the edge in this interactive photo experience task assignment?

My 757 is incredible-I think the teams agree on that.

Will Team Power be able to withstand Omarosa as PM? Smooth sailing is not expected.

Will Plan B miss Trace?

Firing Bret was a tough one for me-but Omarosa doesn't seem to mind.

Omarosa always promises and delivers high drama...

Trace and his team raised an amazing amount of $. Looks like a good season for charities.

There's definitely no love lost between Piers and Omarosa.

Bret had a target on his back from the get go...

That was some episode last week-we've got a great cast!

I will be live tweeting during the @ApprenticeNBC tonight at 9PM ET.

I'm at Trump Doral right now, Tiger will tee off shortly.

How much is South Korea paying the U.S. for protection against North Korea???? NOTHING!

Get the big picture but be prepared for the picture to change. Be persistent and alert every single day.

Resolve to be bigger than your problems. Who’s the boss? Realize that fear is the exact opposite of faith.

@Ziggi92 Good luck.

RT @DoralResort : Thanks! RT @gem3wood : @DonaldJTrumpJr You guys @DoralResort have one hell of a leaderboard. Love this Tournament.

@axelpals Be prepared to go it alone--being an entrepreneur is not, initially, a group effort. Keep your focus. Read Midas Touch.

Make sure to tune in to All-Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC this Sunday at 9PM EST for another round of fireworks and surprises!

@sadatDM . Thanks.

"@signoresifis: Huge fan of @realDonaldTrump i think is a very intelligent and tenacious man. Big role model to me. Thank you.

Go to Trump National Doral, Miami, and watch Tiger, Phil, Ernie, Rory and all of the other great players compete in The WGC Cadillac Champ!

I don't know why but I feel so sorry for dummy reporter John Heilemann when I watch him on television.

John Heilemann, the lightweight reporter begging to be on@morning joe, looks like a timebomb waiting to explode-he's a nervous and sad mess!

@lovitt_marisa Good to hear, enjoy!

@Raul_Esquire Thanks Raul.

@rcmillershow Thank you.

@jlynn_12 Thanks Jessica.

@xo_deannayoung Good subject, good luck!

It’s been great making so many new friends at Trump @DoralResort for the @CadillacChamp . Good luck to everyone!

RT @MollyCBraswell : WHAT?! @realDonaldTrump is speaking at #CPAC2013 ? This conference just became, like, a hundred times more awesome!

Dateline NBC, featuring yours truly, just set a season high in households in the ratings—no wonder NBC likes me so much! @nbc

Without momentum there’s a lack of energy that can lead the best of ideas to nowhere. Get your momentum going-- and keep it going.

It was just announced that @MacMiller ’s song “DonaldTrump” went platinum—tell Mac Miller to kiss my ass!

Heading to Trump National Doral to check the progress prior to the start of the Cadillac Championship on Thursday. I’ll be there all week

For those of you defending Bret and saying Omarosa should go remember Bret chose O which could also be considered a big mistake!

. @CelebApprentice wins 10-11 o’clock hour in all key ratings demographics, including, most importantly, the 18-49 age group.

Glad everyone could see Mar-a-Lago last night on @datelinenbc . It is the crown jewel of Palm Beach.

@foyt4timewinner . Thanks!

"@IDKbrody: " @realDonaldTrump : So, what did you think of my decision? What would you have done? #CelebApprentice " TRUMP PRESIDENT 2016 Great Brande was also smart in not bringing Omarosa to the boardroom.

Brande would have been fired immediately if she didn't raise $132,000, a really large sum. Bret, on the other hand, raised very little...

I will be doing Fox and Friends at 7 A.M. this morning.

So, what did you think of my decision? What would you have done? #CelebApprentice

I'll always like @OMAROSA because she constantly defends me. #CelebApprentice

. @PiersMorgan is right- he won the show because “I know how to play the game.” #CelebApprentice

. @IvankaTrump looks like a movie star from the days of glamour and beauty. #CelebApprentice

Don't worry West Coast etc. we are not going to tweet who was fired or give any indication there of until after it airs. #CelebApprentice

Paul Teutul is always good on the show. #CelebApprentice

Even @PiersMorgan is impressed by @THEGaryBusey . #CelebApprentice

. @OMAROSA as a cashier- a big mistake by @BrandenRoderick . #CelebApprentice

. @KellyandMichael are both wonderful people. Their show is terrific. #CelebApprentice

. @DennisRodman must be thinking of North Korea. #CelebApprentice

. @THEGaryBusey is definitely different. #CelebApprentice

. @PiersMorgan and @OMAROSA really hate each other. #CelebApprentice

. @IvankaTrump and @PiersMorgan will be wonderful advisors. #CelebApprentice

I can’t believe he would choose @OMAROSA as his first choice! She is hard to handle. #CelebApprentice

. @LisaRinna looks better with her reduced lips. Good move, Lisa. #CelebApprentice

Looks like @OMAROSA is up to the challenge. #CelebApprentice

How does this cast look to you? Pretty amazing. #CelebApprentice

Losers and haters,even you, as low and dumb as you are, can learn from watching Apprentice and checking out my tweets-you can still succeed!

Losers and haters are invited to watch Celebrity Apprentice along with the many great and productive people in the hope that you will learn.

I will be live tweeting during the Celebrity Apprentice at 9 P.M. Also will be hosting Dateline just prior to Apprentice at 8 P.M.

@AllenWronowski . Allen and Gail - you will like it - see you both soon!

Everybody wants to see and talk to Dennis Rodman - he will be on Celebrity Apprentice tonight at 9.

@Dattan78. Thanks!

@jennyfromnexus. Great advice!

"@ZarkRiggs: @realDonaldTrump It's all about jealousy. You should just ignore their false reporting." But I'd rather expose them as losers!

@JBoyle007 . True and thanks John!

Really bad article about me in the dying (or dead) Esquire Magazine. Totally false - lots of hatred. When will this boring magazine close?

@scottybuoy13. Thanks!

Remember, Bill Maher praised the animals who took down the World Trade Center and was fired by ABC. DROP@HBO until dopey Bill is canned!

Due to popular demand, @lisarinna returns to the 13th season of All-Star @CelebApprentice . Lisa's fans won't be disappointed!

We should leave Afghanistan immediately. No more wasted lives. If we have to go back in, we go in hard & quick. Rebuild the US first.

Continued success is built on building a brand people know will deliver. Unless you’re @KarlRove . Then you just blame the Tea Party.

Newly minted diplomat @dennisrodman is a completely different competitor in All-Star @CelebApprentice . Dennis is a legend!

Remember, this Sunday I am also featured on @datelinenbc at 8PM, right before the premiere of All-Star @CelebApprentice @nbc likes me!

@FashionFindsbyR Thanks, enjoy!

Pay attention to details. If you don't know every aspect of what you're doing, you're setting yourself up for some big surprises.

I am happy that "The Job" on CBS, the 16th. knockoff of the Apprentice, was just cancelled. I love to see my opponents lose (not nice)!

@saphoros

Our wild man Dennis Rodman, big in the news re North Korea, will be on and watching Celebrity Apprentice on Sunday night!

By popular request, I will be live tweeting during Celebrity Apprentice (Sunday 9 P.M.).

Thanks Matthew!

It is going to be a long and tough road to turn around CNN - they are looking at the wrong people!

Erin Burnett, who has no ratings on CNN in prime time, now wants more money to move to the morning slot. @CNN should say "no way".

Are you a Democrat running in a race you should lose? Get @KarlRove to run an ad against you and you will win.

@JediJerad Thank you.

@TessaHartmann Thanks Tessa.

You haven’t seen fireworks until you see @OMAROSA & @piersmorgan go at it again! Let’s just say it’s no happy reunion…

Over the years, I've discovered that for a brand to build, the people surrounding it have to work exceptionally well together.

One good aspect of the Obama depression is that it will separate the winners from the losers. If you can make it now, you deserve it!

Remember, no one ever said success was easy.Good luck doesn’t come overnight.But if u work hard & love it, u will find success & luck.

I am very proud of @StephenBaldwin7 ’s performance in the record 13th season of All-Star @CelebApprentice . Watch.

Everyone is excited for @THEGaryBusey ’s return to All-Star @CelebApprentice . Be warned, this time Gary is even more insane!

Be sure to watch “The History of WrestleMania” on @netflix . My interview explains how I supported the event early on. I'm proud of it.

Karl Rove’s ads are the worst in political history!

Karl Rove’s stupid ad made Ashley Judd hot—now everybody is talking about her.

Ashley Judd has just thanked Karl Rove for all the attention he has given her—unreal!—how stupid can we get?

If Mitch McConnell wants to win his election, he’d better get rid of jinxed Karl Rove and fast. Rove’s ad campaign has made Ashley Judd a totally credible candidate. Be careful Mitch!

How come nobody mentions that the Nielsen Ratings of the Apprentice, after 12 seasons-- as shown by Howard Stern --totally blow away the ratings of Shark Tank. Everyone was hitting on me until the numbers came in—and now—dead silence!

@finger_slinger Thanks Davis.

@clstromgren Many people have said that.

@JustKieffer @GoAngelo @macy Not much!

@Obomination1 @GoAngelo @macy Thanks.

The government will spend over $3.8T this year. The sequester is a pittance of the outlays, less than 2%. Where’s the problem?

Isn’t it ironic that President Obama, of all people, is pushing for ‘universal background checks?!'

@WetzelDrake @ApprenticeNBC Thanks.

@ed_the_honest Thanks Ed.

@stacihogan True!

@nal53199 I will.

@CraryJohn There is none.

@TexasBlingMom Interesting.

@BrooksStephen @marissamayer True and thanks.

@kat3500 Fantastic.

@sdcrane @marissamayer Excellent.

@scotty752 Thanks Scott.

@lynk339 Thanks.

There was a major diplomatic breakthrough yesterday w/the White House, Iran & China. All celebrated Chuck Hagel being voted in as SOD.

Is everything ok over there @Salon ? I actually got some good press from them today.

@RyanTheDee Hopefully he will not destroy Scotland.

@TheRealChosen1 Thanks and good luck.

@ialia Great! Just won five-star ratings for hotel and restaurant from Forbes Travel Guide.

@emanaydin Made a mistake but will recover.

@pfgabriel Yes and thanks.

@Thomasbrennan01 Great architect!

@BrianSchnitzler I often ask that question myself.

@Lifelongcane True and thanks.

Everyone loves TV’s darling @TheRealMarilu . But wait until you see her tough & competitive side in the upcoming @CelebApprentice !

Great news - @BarbaraJWalters has fully recovered and will be back on @theviewtv this coming Monday. Barbara is wonderful!

The Pope should not have resigned—he should have lived it out. It hurts him, it hurts the church and says something is seriously wrong. He will never go down as great!

@KyMdeLange Wow, what a great honor--thanks.

Heading over to@Kelly and Michael re. Apprentice!

@Trish3D @TraceAdkins @CelebApprentice @RedCross He's great!

"@ChrisCannizzo7: @realDonaldTrump great appearance!" Thanks.

"@camiladerosax: favorite family will always be the trumps @realdonaldtrump " Thanks.

@HoppMar . Great and thanks.

"@MrMikeLobikis: @realDonaldTrump Proud of you, bruh." Thanks!

Will be on Howard Stern at 6.45 A.M. and the Today Show at 8.00 A.M.

I'll bet Jimmy Fallon gets great ratings tonight!

Jimmy Fallon show will be great tonight - I'm on!

Why does@Bill O'Reilly keep putting Karl Rove on his show-a total waste of time. Rove spent $400, 000, 000 and didn't win a race-pathetic!

On Jimmy Fallon tonight.

Dopey @billmaher still owes me $5M for charity. I hope he pays up before @hbo fires him--which will happen!

. @tedcruz must be doing something right if @cher , sadly rated “the 4th ugliest celebrity” according to @listverse , is attacking him.

You have to feel bad for the Democrat Senators. They don’t want Hagel either. Just following Obama’s orders.

The ruling @GOP consultant class of losers like @KarlRove have no respect for the Tea Party. They do this at their own peril!

@GjelajG Be passionate about your work, focus, and never give up.

Country music star @TraceAdkins returns to All-Star @CelebApprentice . Competing for @RedCross , Trace is great!

I will be on @LateNightJimmy tonight. Always have a good time with @jimmyfallon . Now we know he will get high ratings tonight.

One of the reasons, I assume, I was inducted into the @WWE Hall of Fame is that Vince McMahon and I have the all time highest ratings and pay per view records with “Battle of the Billionaires” in Detroit. It was a wild day!

It is a great honor for me to be inducted into the @WWE Hall of Fame. This will take place on April 6 at Madison Square Garden followed by a ceremony with 80,000 people at MetLife Stadium, Wrestlemania.
